            "summary": "In this paper, we propose a domain-decomposition-based deep learning (DL)\nframework, named transient-CoMLSim, for accurately modeling unsteady and\nnonlinear partial differential equations (PDEs). The framework consists of two\nkey components: (a) a convolutional neural network (CNN)-based autoencoder\narchitecture and (b) an autoregressive model composed of fully connected\nlayers. Unlike existing state-of-the-art methods that operate on the entire\ncomputational domain, our CNN-based autoencoder computes a lower-dimensional\nbasis for solution and condition fields represented on subdomains. Timestepping\nis performed entirely in the latent space, generating embeddings of the\nsolution variables from the time history of embeddings of solution and\ncondition variables. This approach not only reduces computational complexity\nbut also enhances scalability, making it well-suited for large-scale\nsimulations. Furthermore, to improve the stability of our rollouts, we employ a\ncurriculum learning (CL) approach during the training of the autoregressive\nmodel. The domain-decomposition strategy enables scaling to out-of-distribution\ndomain sizes while maintaining the accuracy of predictions -- a feature not\neasily integrated into popular DL-based approaches for physics simulations. We\nbenchmark our model against two widely-used DL architectures, Fourier Neural\nOperator (FNO) and U-Net, and demonstrate that our framework outperforms them\nin terms of accuracy, extrapolation to unseen timesteps, and stability for a\nwide range of use cases.",

In physics, correlations in fluctuating microscopic observables can\nprovide key information about collective states of matter such as deconfined\nquark-gluon plasma in heavy-ion collisions or expanding quantum degenerate\ngases. Two-particle correlations in mesoscopic colliders have provided\nsmoking-gun evidence on the nature of exotic electronic excitations such as\nfractional charges, levitons and anyon statistics. Yet the gap between\ntwo-particle collisions and the emergence of collectivity as the number of\ninteracting particles grows is hard to address at the microscopic level. Here,\nwe demonstrate all-body correlations in the partitioning of up to $N = 5$\nelectron droplets driven by a moving potential well through a Y-junction in a\nsemiconductor. We show that the measured multivariate cumulants (of order $k =\n2$ to $N$) of the electron droplet are accurately described by $k$-spin\ncorrelation functions of an effective Ising model below the N\\'eel temperature\nand can be interpreted as a Coulomb liquid in the thermodynamic limit. Finite\nsize scaling of high-order correlation functions provides otherwise\ninaccessible fingerprints of emerging order.

Here, we propose and investigate an\nunsupervised machine learning (ML) task: estimating the FIM given limited\nsamples from a multivariate probability distribution of measurements made\nthroughout the phase diagram. We utilize an unsupervised ML method called\nClassiFIM (developed in a companion paper) to solve this task and demonstrate\nits empirical effectiveness in detecting both quantum and classical phase\ntransitions using a variety of spin and fermionic models, for which we generate\nseveral publicly available datasets with accompanying ground-truth FIM. We find\nthat ClassiFIM reliably detects both topological (e.g., XXZ chain) and\ndynamical (e.g., metal-insulator transition in Hubbard model) quantum phase\ntransitions. We perform a detailed quantitative comparison with prior\nunsupervised ML methods for detecting quantum phase transitions. We demonstrate\nthat ClassiFIM is competitive with these prior methods in terms of appropriate\naccuracy metrics while requiring significantly less resource-intensive training\ndata compared to the original formulation of the prior methods. In particular,\nClassiFIM only requires classical (single-basis) measurements. As part of our\nmethodology development, we prove several theorems connecting the classical and\nquantum fidelity susceptibilities through equalities or bounds.

These structures tend to be spatially large and temporally slow,\nand may contain most of the energy in a given flow. The extraction and\nparsimonious representation of these low-rank dynamics from high-dimensional\ndata is a key challenge. Inspired by the success of physics-informed machine\nlearning methods, we propose a spectrally-informed approach to extract low-rank\nmodels of fluid flows by leveraging known spectral properties in the learning\nprocess. We incorporate this knowledge by imposing regularizations on the\nlearned dynamics, which bias the training process towards learning\nlow-frequency structures with corresponding higher power.

We explicitly demonstrate that the modifications to the\nposition-momentum algebra are proportional to curvature invariants (such as the\nRicci scalar and Kretschmann scalar). Our results, derived through a rigorous\napplication of Dirac's quantization procedure, demonstrate that infrared\neffects in quantum systems can be axiomatically derived. We study particle\ndynamics in an arbitrary curved spacetime by embedding them in a\nhigher-dimensional flat geometry. Our approach, which involves embedding\nparticle dynamics in a higher-dimensional flat geometry and utilizing Dirac's\nquantization procedure, allows us to capture the dynamics of a particle in\n4-dimensional curved spacetime through a modified position-momentum algebra.\nWhen applied to various spacetimes, this method reveals that the corrections\ndue to the spacetime curvature are universal.

            "summary": "The robotics community has consistently aimed to achieve generalizable robot\nmanipulation with flexible natural language instructions. One of the primary\nchallenges is that obtaining robot data fully annotated with both actions and\ntexts is time-consuming and labor-intensive. However, partially annotated data,\nsuch as human activity videos without action labels and robot play data without\nlanguage labels, is much easier to collect. Can we leverage these data to\nenhance the generalization capability of robots? In this paper, we propose\nGR-MG, a novel method which supports conditioning on both a language\ninstruction and a goal image. During training, GR-MG samples goal images from\ntrajectories and conditions on both the text and the goal image or solely on\nthe image when text is unavailable. During inference, where only the text is\nprovided, GR-MG generates the goal image via a diffusion-based image-editing\nmodel and condition on both the text and the generated image. This approach\nenables GR-MG to leverage large amounts of partially annotated data while still\nusing language to flexibly specify tasks. To generate accurate goal images, we\npropose a novel progress-guided goal image generation model which injects task\nprogress information into the generation process, significantly improving the\nfidelity and the performance.

Much effort has been\ndevoted to improving tractography methodology for adult brains, while\ntractography of the fetal brain has been largely neglected. Fetal tractography\nfaces unique difficulties due to low dMRI signal quality, immature and rapidly\ndeveloping brain structures, and paucity of reference data. This work presents\nthe first machine learning model for fetal tractography. The model input\nconsists of five sources of information: (1) Fiber orientation, inferred from a\ndiffusion tensor fit to the dMRI signal; (2) Directions of recent propagation\nsteps; (3) Global spatial information, encoded as distances to keypoints in the\nbrain cortex; (4) Tissue segmentation information; and (5) Prior information\nabout the expected local fiber orientations supplied with an atlas. In order to\nmitigate the local tensor estimation error, a large spatial context around the\ncurrent point in the diffusion tensor image is encoded using convolutional and\nattention neural network modules. Moreover, the diffusion tensor information at\na hypothetical next point is included in the model input. Filtering rules based\non anatomically constrained tractography are applied to prune implausible\nstreamlines. We trained the model on manually-refined whole-brain fetal\ntractograms and validated the trained model on an independent set of 11 test\nscans with gestational ages between 23 and 36 weeks.
