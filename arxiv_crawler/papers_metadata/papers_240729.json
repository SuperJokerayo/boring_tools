            "summary": "In inference problems, we often have domain knowledge which allows us to\ndefine summary statistics that capture most of the information content in a\ndataset. In this paper, we present a hybrid approach, where such physics-based\nsummaries are augmented by a set of compressed neural summary statistics that\nare optimised to extract the extra information that is not captured by the\npredefined summaries. The resulting statistics are very powerful inputs to\nsimulation-based or implicit inference of model parameters. We apply this\ngeneralisation of Information Maximising Neural Networks (IMNNs) to parameter\nconstraints from tomographic weak gravitational lensing convergence maps to\nfind summary statistics that are explicitly optimised to complement angular\npower spectrum estimates. We study several dark matter simulation resolutions\nin low- and high-noise regimes. We show that i) the information-update\nformalism extracts at least $3\\times$ and up to $8\\times$ as much information\nas the angular power spectrum in all noise regimes, ii) the network summaries\nare highly complementary to existing 2-point summaries, and iii) our formalism\nallows for networks with smaller, physically-informed architectures to match\nmuch larger regression networks with far fewer simulations needed to obtain\nasymptotically optimal inference.",

In this work, we push the boundaries of learning-based in-hand\nmanipulation systems by demonstrating the capability to spin pen-like objects.\nWe first use reinforcement learning to train an oracle policy with privileged\ninformation and generate a high-fidelity trajectory dataset in simulation. This\nserves two purposes: 1) pre-training a sensorimotor policy in simulation; 2)\nconducting open-loop trajectory replay in the real world. We then fine-tune the\nsensorimotor policy using these real-world trajectories to adapt it to the real\nworld dynamics. With less than 50 trajectories, our policy learns to rotate\nmore than ten pen-like objects with different physical properties for multiple\nrevolutions. We present a comprehensive analysis of our design choices and\nshare the lessons learned during development.",

Currently, the best\ndeterministic single-photon sources use a semiconductor quantum dot embedded in\nan optical microcavity. However, coherent spin control has not yet been\nintegrated with a state-of-the-art single-photon source, and the magnetic noise\nfrom host nuclear spins in the semiconductor environment has placed strong\nlimitations on the spin coherence. Here, we combine high-fidelity all-optical\nspin control with a quantum dot in an open microcavity, currently the most\nefficient single-photon source platform available. By imprinting a microwave\nsignal onto a red-detuned optical field, a Raman process, we demonstrate\ncoherent rotations of a hole spin around an arbitrary axis of the Bloch sphere,\nachieving a maximum {\\pi}-pulse fidelity of 98.6%. The cavity enhances the\nRaman process, enabling ultra-fast Rabi frequencies above 1 GHz. We use our\nflexible spin control to perform optical cooling of the nuclear spins in the\nhost material via the central hole spin, extending the hole-spin coherence time\nT2* from 28 ns to 535 ns. Hahn echo preserves the spin coherence on a timescale\nof 20 {\\mu}s, and dynamical decoupling extends the coherence close to the\nrelaxation limit.

The balance between unwanted backaction and the\nprecision of optical measurements impose a standard quantum limit (SQL) on\ninterferometric systems. In order to realize a sensitivity below the SQL, it is\nnecessary to leverage a back-action evading measurement technique, or else\nexploit cancellations of any excess noise contributions at the detector. %Many\nproof of principle experiments have been performed, but only recently has an\nexperiment achieved sensitivity below the SQL. In this work, we extend that\ninitial demonstration and realize sub-SQL measurement sensitivity nearly two\ntimes better than previous measurements, and with architecture applicable to\ninterferometric gravitational wave detectors. In fact, this technique is\ndirectly applicable to Advanced LIGO, which could observe similar effects with\na detuned signal recycling cavity. By exploiting quantum correlations created\nby an optical spring, we measure a total sensitivity below the SQL by\n$\\textbf{2.8}$ dB, corresponding to a reduction in the noise power by\n$\\textbf{72}\\pm\\textbf{5.1}$ \\% below the quantum limit. Through the use of a\ndetuned optical spring, this noise reduction is tunable, allowing us to choose\nthe desired range of frequencies that fall below the SQL.

Furthermore, such\nHiggs-portal models of dark matter should be suitably harmonised with the\nvarious epochs of the universe and the phenomenological constraints imposed by\ncollider experiments. At the same time, the prospect of a stochastic\ngravitational wave background offers a promising new window into the primordial\nuniverse, which can complement the insights gained from accelerators. In this\nstudy, we examined whether gravitational waves can be generated from a\ncurvature-induced phase transition of a non-minimally coupled dark scalar field\nwith a portal coupling to the Higgs field. The main requirement is that the\nphase transition is of first order, which can be achieved through the\nintroduction of a cubic term on the scalar potential and the sign change of the\ncurvature scalar. This mechanism was investigated in the context of a dynamical\nspacetime during the transition from inflation to kination, while also\nconsidering the possibility for inducing electroweak symmetry breaking in this\nmanner for a sufficiently low reheating temperature when the Higgs-portal\ncoupling is extremely weak. We considered a large range of inflationary scales\nand both cases of positive and negative values for the non-minimal coupling,\nwhile taking into account the bound imposed by Big Bang Nucleosythesis. The\nresulting gravitational wave amplitudes are boosted by kination and thus\nconstrain the parameter space of the couplings significantly.

We propose a method to make\nprogress on both of these issues. When an oscillating field is applied to a\nTLS, stochastic resonance can occur and the noise spectrum is moved to higher\nfrequencies. This shift in the TLS noise spectrum will increase the dephasing\ntimes of the qubits that they influence. Furthermore, the details of this\neffect depend on the physical properties of the noise sources. Thus one can use\nqubit spectroscopy to investigate their physical properties, specifically the\nextent to which the TLS themselves possess quantum coherence.

To\nmitigate these challenges, existing studies commonly incorporate additional\nmodal information matching the visual data to regularize the model's learning\nprocess, enabling the extraction of high-quality visual features from complex\nimage regions. Specifically, in the realm of multimodal learning, cross-modal\nalignment is recognized as an effective strategy, harmonizing different modal\ninformation by learning a domain-consistent latent feature space for visual and\nsemantic features. However, this approach may face limitations due to the\nheterogeneity between multimodal information, such as differences in feature\ndistribution and structure. To address this issue, we introduce a Multimodal\nAlignment and Reconstruction Network (MARNet), designed to enhance the model's\nresistance to visual noise. Importantly, MARNet includes a cross-modal\ndiffusion reconstruction module for smoothly and stably blending information\nacross different domains. Experiments conducted on two benchmark datasets,\nVireo-Food172 and Ingredient-101, demonstrate that MARNet effectively improves\nthe quality of image information extracted by the model.

This algorithm is built upon a recursive series of Bayesian\nposteriors using a method we call Greedy Bayes. Sampling of the Bayesian\nposterior for neuron weight vectors $w$ of dimension $d$ is challenging because\nof its multimodality. Our algorithm to tackle this problem is based on a\ncoupling of the posterior density for $w$ with an auxiliary random variable\n$\\xi$.\n  The resulting reverse conditional $w|\\xi$ of neuron weights given auxiliary\nrandom variable is shown to be log concave. In the construction of the\nposterior distributions we provide some freedom in the choice of the prior. In\nparticular, for Gaussian priors on $w$ with suitably small variance, the\nresulting marginal density of the auxiliary variable $\\xi$ is proven to be\nstrictly log concave for all dimensions $d$. For a uniform prior on the unit\n$\\ell_1$ ball, evidence is given that the density of $\\xi$ is again strictly\nlog concave for sufficiently large $d$.\n  The score of the marginal density of the auxiliary random variable $\\xi$ is\ndetermined by an expectation over $w|\\xi$ and thus can be computed by various\nrapidly mixing Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods. Moreover, the computation of\nthe score of $\\xi$ permits methods of sampling $\\xi$ by a stochastic diffusion\n(Langevin dynamics) with drift function built from this score. With such\ndynamics, information-theoretic methods pioneered by Bakry and Emery show that\naccurate sampling of $\\xi$ is obtained rapidly when its density is indeed\nstrictly log-concave.

We\ndemonstrate that yes, certain 3D scene representations are encoded in the text\nembedding space of models like Stable Diffusion. Our approach, Viewpoint Neural\nTextual Inversion (ViewNeTI), is to discover 3D view tokens; these tokens\ncontrol the 3D viewpoint - the rendering pose in a scene - of generated images.\nSpecifically, we train a small neural mapper to take continuous camera\nviewpoint parameters and predict a view token (a word embedding). This token\nconditions diffusion generation via cross-attention to produce images with the\ndesired camera viewpoint. Using ViewNeTI as an evaluation tool, we report two\nfindings: first, the text latent space has a continuous view-control manifold\nfor particular 3D scenes; second, we find evidence for a generalized\nview-control manifold for all scenes. We conclude that since the view token\ncontrols the 3D `rendering' viewpoint, there is likely a scene representation\nembedded in frozen 2D diffusion models. Finally, we exploit the 3D scene\nrepresentations for 3D vision tasks, namely, view-controlled text-to-image\ngeneration, and novel view synthesis from a single image, where our approach\nsets state-of-the-art for LPIPS.
