It has\npreviously been shown that with antiferromagnetic (AFM) oscillators, ultra-fast\nspiking artificial neurons can be made that mimic many unique features of\nbiological neurons. In this work, we train an artificial neural network of AFM\nneurons to perform pattern recognition. A simple machine learning algorithm\ncalled spike pattern association neuron (SPAN), which relies on the temporal\nposition of neuron spikes, is used during training. In under a microsecond of\nphysical time, the AFM neural network is trained to recognize symbols composed\nfrom a grid by producing a spike within a specified time window. We further\nachieve multi-symbol recognition with the addition of an output layer to\nsuppress undesirable spikes. Through the utilization of AFM neurons and the\nSPAN algorithm, we create a neural network capable of high-accuracy recognition\nwith overall power consumption on the order of picojoules.",

            "summary": "The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are\none of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs\n(Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard\nmodel theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion\nof CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they\nhave the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant\nconversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature\nfluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant\nconversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field,\nelectron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can\nhappen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will\nlead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The\nspectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different\nfrom the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum\nwill be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence,\nwith the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its\nspectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds.\nAn SNR of $\\sim$ 4.36 and $\\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band\nand CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of\n$\\mathrm{g_{a \\gamma} = 10^{-12} \\, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond\nredshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of\n$\\sim \\mathrm{7.5 \\times 10^{-2} \\, \\mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any\nsignal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and\nCMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from\nparticle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).",

However, the transversal CNOT can propagate errors from one logical\nqubit to another, leading to correlated errors between logical qubits.

Recent solvers for SB\nexploit the pervasive bridge matching procedures. Such procedures aim to\nrecover a stochastic process transporting the mass between distributions given\nonly a transport plan between them. In particular, given the EOT plan, these\nprocedures can be adapted to solve SB. This fact is heavily exploited by recent\nworks giving rise to matching-based SB solvers. The cornerstone here is\nrecovering the EOT plan: recent works either use heuristical approximations\n(e.g., the minibatch OT) or establish iterative matching procedures which by\nthe design accumulate the error during the training. We address these\nlimitations and propose a novel procedure to learn SB which we call the\n\\textbf{optimal Schr\\\"odinger bridge matching}. It exploits the optimal\nparameterization of the diffusion process and provably recovers the SB process\n\\textbf{(a)} with a single bridge matching step and \\textbf{(b)} with arbitrary\ntransport plan as the input. Furthermore, we show that the optimal bridge\nmatching objective coincides with the recently discovered energy-based modeling\n(EBM) objectives to learn EOT/SB.

            "summary": "The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in working environments with\nindividuals, known as Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC), has become essential in a\nvariety of domains, boosting decision-making, efficiency, and innovation.\nDespite HAIC's wide potential, evaluating its effectiveness remains challenging\ndue to the complex interaction of components involved.\n  This paper provides a detailed analysis of existing HAIC evaluation\napproaches and develops a fresh paradigm for more effectively evaluating these\nsystems.\n  Our framework includes a structured decision tree which assists to select\nrelevant metrics based on distinct HAIC modes (AI-Centric, Human-Centric, and\nSymbiotic). By including both quantitative and qualitative metrics, the\nframework seeks to represent HAIC's dynamic and reciprocal nature, enabling the\nassessment of its impact and success. This framework's practicality can be\nexamined by its application in an array of domains, including manufacturing,\nhealthcare, finance, and education, each of which has unique challenges and\nrequirements. Our hope is that this study will facilitate further research on\nthe systematic evaluation of HAIC in real-world applications.",
