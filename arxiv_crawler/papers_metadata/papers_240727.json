Looking to the future, projections for the High Luminosity LHC\n(HL-LHC) indicate a superlinear growth for required computing resources for\nsingle-threaded CPU algorithms that surpass the computing resources that are\nexpected to be available. The combination of these facts creates the need for\nefficient and computationally performant pattern recognition algorithms that\nwill be able to run in parallel and possibly on other hardware, such as GPUs,\ngiven that these become more and more available in LHC experiments and\nhigh-performance computing centres. Line Segment Tracking (LST) is a novel such\nalgorithm which has been developed to be fully parallelizable and hardware\nagnostic. The latter is achieved through the usage of the Alpaka library. The\nLST algorithm has been tested with the CMS central software as an external\npackage and has been used in the context of the CMS HL-LHC High Level Trigger\n(HLT). When employing LST for pattern recognition in the HLT tracking, the\nphysics and timing performances are shown to improve with respect to the ones\nutilizing the current pattern recognition algorithms. The latest results on the\nusage of the LST algorithm within the CMS HL-LHC HLT are presented, along with\nprospects for further improvements of the algorithm and its CMS central\nsoftware integration.",

Discovered in 1961, it\ndescribes the exterior vacuum of a spherical Brans-Dicke star and is\ncharacterized by two adjustable parameters. Surprisingly, the relationship\nbetween these parameters and the properties of the star has not been rigorously\nestablished. In this Proceeding, we bridge this gap by deriving $\\textit{the}$\ncomplete exterior solution of Brans Class I, expressed in terms of the total\nenergy and total pressure of the spherisymmetric gravity source. The solution\nallows for the $\\textit{exact}$ derivation of $\\textit{all}$ post-Newtonian\nparameters in Brans-Dicke gravity for far field regions of a spherical source.\nParticularly for the $\\gamma$ parameter, instead of the conventional result\n$\\gamma_{\\,\\text{PPN}}=\\frac{\\omega+1}{\\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical\nexpression\n$\\gamma_{\\,\\text{exact}}=\\frac{\\omega+1+(\\omega+2)\\,\\Theta}{\\omega+2+(\\omega+1)\\,\\Theta}$\nwhere $\\Theta$ is the ratio of the total pressure\n$P_{\\parallel}^{*}+2P_{\\perp}^{*}$ and total energy $E^{*}$ contained within\nthe mass source. Our $\\textit{non-perturbative}$ $\\gamma$ formula is valid for\nall field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source.\nConsequently, observational constraints on $\\gamma$ thus set $\\textit{joint}$\nbounds on $\\omega$ and $\\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global\ncharacteristic of the mass source.

This obtained solution\ncarries four independent conserved charges: the mass, two angular momenta, an\nelectric charge, and an additional dipole charge related to other charges. By\nemploying the Ehlers-Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by\ntransforming a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution in the\ntheory. Previously, our work produced a vacuum doubly rotating black ring\nsolution possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity by using the Ehlers\ntransformation. In this study, we use the singular black ring as the seed for\nthe Harrison transformation. The resultant solution exhibits regularity, free\nfrom curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities,\nDirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and\noutside the horizon. We show that within a specific parameter range, the black\nring presents two branches for the same mass, two angular momenta and electric\ncharge but these are distinguished by a dipole charge, which exhibits\ndiscontinuous non-uniqueness. Furthermore, this newly obtained black ring\nseamlessly connects to various physically significant solutions, such as the\nPomeransky-Sen'kov black ring, the extremal black ring, the supersymmetric\nblack ring, and the charged singly-spinning black ring.",

We unify these two lines of work and present 3D Diffuser\nActor, a neural policy equipped with a novel 3D denoising transformer that\nfuses information from the 3D visual scene, a language instruction and\nproprioception to predict the noise in noised 3D robot pose trajectories. 3D\nDiffuser Actor sets a new state-of-the-art on RLBench with an absolute\nperformance gain of 18.1% over the current SOTA on a multi-view setup and an\nabsolute gain of 13.1% on a single-view setup.

Especially, when hands are in complex pose\nsuch as interacting hands, the problems like appearance similarity, self-handed\noccclusion and depth ambiguity make it more difficult. To overcome these\nissues, we propose AttentionHand, a novel method for text-driven controllable\nhand image generation. Since AttentionHand can generate various and numerous\nin-the-wild hand images well-aligned with 3D hand label, we can acquire a new\n3D hand dataset, and can relieve the domain gap between indoor and outdoor\nscenes. Our method needs easy-to-use four modalities (i.e, an RGB image, a hand\nmesh image from 3D label, a bounding box, and a text prompt). These modalities\nare embedded into the latent space by the encoding phase. Then, through the\ntext attention stage, hand-related tokens from the given text prompt are\nattended to highlight hand-related regions of the latent embedding. After the\nhighlighted embedding is fed to the visual attention stage, hand-related\nregions in the embedding are attended by conditioning global and local hand\nmesh images with the diffusion-based pipeline. In the decoding phase, the final\nfeature is decoded to new hand images, which are well-aligned with the given\nhand mesh image and text prompt. As a result, AttentionHand achieved\nstate-of-the-art among text-to-hand image generation models, and the\nperformance of 3D hand mesh reconstruction was improved by additionally\ntraining with hand images generated by AttentionHand.",
