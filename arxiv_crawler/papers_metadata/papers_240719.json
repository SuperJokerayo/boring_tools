We present a neural network\narchitecture for predicting front tire lateral force as a drop-in replacement\nfor physics-based approaches. With a full-scale automated vehicle purpose-built\nfor the drifting application, we deploy these models in a nonlinear model\npredictive controller tuned for tracking a reference drifting trajectory, for\ndirect comparisons of model performance. The neural network tire model exhibits\nsignificantly improved path tracking performance over the brush tire model in\ncases where front-axle braking force is applied, suggesting the neural\nnetwork's ability to express previously unmodeled, latent dynamics in the\ndrifting condition.",

            "summary": "Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the\nstudy of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For\ngauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge\ninvariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that\nis larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge\ninvariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation\nof Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the\nsystem in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce\ncomponents outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge\ndrift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our\nmethod relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally,\na technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to\nreduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a\n$\\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.",

Because of the non-perturbative nature of\nquantum chromodynamics (QCD), little is known rigorously about hadronic matter\nin these extreme conditions. Here, lattice QCD calculations are used to compute\nthermodynamic quantities and the equation of state of QCD over a wide range of\nisospin chemical potentials. Agreement is seen with chiral perturbation theory\npredictions when the chemical potential is small. Comparison to perturbative\nQCD calculations at large chemical potential allows for an estimate of the gap\nin the superconducting phase, and this quantity is seen to agree with\nperturbative determinations. Since the partition function for an isospin\nchemical potential, $\\mu_I$, bounds the partition function for a baryon\nchemical potential $\\mu_B=3\\mu_I/2$, these calculations also provide rigorous\nnon-perturbative QCD bounds on the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state\nover a wide range of baryon densities for the first time.",

The model constants are\ndetermined based on their definition in terms of the Stokes flow, the potential\nflow and steady nonlinear flow. Thus, the discrepancies between the model\npredictions and the simulation data can be attributed to shortcomings of the\nmodels' parametrisation.\n  We found that an extension of the dynamic permeability model of Pride et al.\n[Physical Review B 47(9), 1993] with a Forchheimer-type nonlinearity performs\nvery well for linear flow and for nonlinear flow at low and medium frequencies,\nbut the Forchheimer term with a coefficient obtained from the steady-state\noverpredicts the nonlinear drag at high frequencies. The model reduces to the\nunsteady Forchheimer equation with an acceleration coefficient based on the\nstatic viscous tortuosity for low frequencies.\n  The unsteady Forchheimer equation with an acceleration coefficient based on\nthe high frequency limit of the dynamic tortuosity has large errors for linear\nflow at medium and high frequencies, but low errors for nonlinear flow at all\nfrequencies.

Identification of these ''active\nsites'' has relied heavily on extrapolation to supported NP systems from\ninvestigation of idealized surfaces, experimentally using single crystals or\nsupported NPs which are always modelled computationally using slab or regular\npolyhedra models. However, the ability of these methods to predict catalytic\nactivity remains qualitative at best, as the structure of metal NPs in reactive\nenvironments has only been speculated from indirect experimental observations,\nor otherwise remains wholly unknown. Here, by circumventing these limitations\nfor highly accurate simulation methods, we provide direct atomistic insight\ninto the dynamic restructuring of metal NPs by combining in situ spectroscopy\nwith molecular dynamics simulations powered by a machine learned force field.\nWe find that in reactive environments, NP surfaces evolve to a state with\npoorly defined atomic order, while the core of the NP may remain bulk-like.\nThese insights prove that long-standing conceptual models based on idealized\nfaceting for small metal NP systems are not representative of real systems\nunder exposure to reactive environments. We show that the resultant structure\ncan be elucidated by combining advanced spectroscopy and computational tools.\nThis discovery exemplifies that to enable faithful quantitative predictions of\ncatalyst function and stability, we must move beyond idealized-facet\nexperimental and theoretical models and instead employ systems which include\nrealistic surface structures that respond to relevant physical and chemical\nconditions.",

Confronted with the fact that exact\ndiagonalisation quickly becomes impossible when increasing the system size,\nvariational approaches are typically employed as a scalable alternative: energy\nis minimised over a subset of all possible states and then different physical\nquantities are computed over the solution state. Despite remarkable success,\nrigorously speaking, all what variational methods offer are upper bounds on the\nground-state energy. On the other hand, so-called relaxations of the\nground-state problem based on semidefinite programming represent a\ncomplementary approach, providing lower bounds to the ground-state energy.\nHowever, in their current implementation, neither variational nor relaxation\nmethods offer provable bound on other observables in the ground state beyond\nthe energy. In this work, we show that the combination of the two classes of\napproaches can be used to derive certifiable bounds on the value of any\nobservable in the ground state, such as correlation functions of arbitrary\norder, structure factors, or order parameters. We illustrate the power of this\napproach in paradigmatic examples of 1D and 2D spin-one-half Heisenberg models.\nTo improve the scalability of the method, we exploit the symmetries and\nsparsity of the considered systems to reach sizes of hundreds of particles at\nmuch higher precision than previous works.
