            "authors": "Ruoshi Jiang, Fangyuan Gu, Wei Ku",
            "summary": "Strongly correlated materials are known to display qualitatively distinct\nemergent behaviors at low energy. Conveniently, the superposition principle of\nquantum mechanics ensures that, upon absorbing quantum fluctuation, these rich\nlow-energy behaviors can always be effectively described by dressed particles\nwith fully quantized charge, spin, and orbitals structure. Such a powerful and\nsimple description is, however, difficult to access through density functional\ntheory (DFT) calculations, since in terms of bare particles the quantum\nfluctuation would heavily smear the quantized quantities. To address this\ndifficulty, we propose an `interaction annealing' approach to decipher the\ndominant valence and orbital structure by suppressing the charge fluctuation\nthrough enhancing ionic charging energy. Applying this approach to\nferroelectric semi-metal WTe${_2}$ as a demonstration, we identify a dominant\nferro-orbital ordered structure with W ion in a $d^2$ spin-0 configuration. The\nproposed approach is straightforward to implement in standard DFT calculations\nto grant additional access to essential low-energy physics.",

When addressing\ncompressible flows, in addition to preserving kinetic energy at a discrete\nlevel, as done in the incompressible case, additional properties are sought\nafter, such as the ability to preserve the equilibrium of pressure that can be\nfound at contact interfaces. This paper investigates the general conditions of\nthe spatial numerical discretizations to achieve the pressure equilibrium\npreserving property (PEP). Schemes from the literature are analyzed in this\nrespect, and procedures to impart the PEP property to existing discretizations\nare proposed. Additionally, new PEP numerical schemes are introduced through\nminor modifications of classical ones. Numerical tests confirmed the theory\nhereby presented and showed that the modifications, beyond the enforcement of\nthe PEP property, have a generally positive impact on the performances of the\noriginal schemes.",

ELMs\ncause a loss of energy and damage the vessel walls. Understanding the physics\nof ELMs and by extension, how to detect and mitigate them, is an important\nchallenge. In this paper, we focus on two diagnostic methods $\\unicode{x2013}$\nD-alpha spectroscopy and Doppler backscattering (DBS). The former detects ELMs\nby measuring Balmer alpha emission while the latter uses microwave radiation to\nprobe the plasma. DBS has the advantage of having higher temporal resolution\nand robustness to damage. These advantages of DBS diagnostics may be beneficial\nfor future operational tokamaks and thus data processing techniques for DBS\nshould be developed in preparation. In sight of this, we explore the training\nof neural networks to detect ELMs from DBS data, using D-alpha data as the\nground truth. With shots found in the DIII-D database, the model is trained to\nclassify each time step based on the occurrence of an ELM event. The results\nare promising. When tested on shots similar to those used for training, the\nmodel is capable of consistently achieving a high f1-score of 0.93. This score\nis a performance metric for imbalanced datasets that ranges between 0 and 1. We\nevaluate the performance of our neural network on a variety of ELMs\n$\\unicode{x2013}$ grasssy, suppressed, and wide pedestal $\\unicode{x2013}$\nfinding broad applicability.

The strength of correlations varies smoothly as\na function of external kinematics, which is encoded in differential equations\nsatisfied by cosmological correlation functions. In this work, we provide a\nbroader perspective on the origin and structure of these differential\nequations. As a concrete example, we study conformally coupled scalar fields in\na power-law cosmology. The wavefunction coefficients in this model have\nintegral representations, with the integrands being the product of the\ncorresponding flat-space results and \"twist factors\" that depend on the\ncosmological evolution. These integrals are part of a finite-dimensional basis\nof master integrals, which satisfy a system of first-order differential\nequations. We develop a formalism to derive these differential equations for\narbitrary tree graphs. The results can be represented in graphical form by\nassociating the singularities of the differential equations with a set of graph\ntubings. Upon differentiation, these tubings grow in a local and predictive\nfashion. In fact, a few remarkably simple rules allow us to predict -- by hand\n-- the equations for all tree graphs. While the rules of this \"kinematic flow\"\nare defined purely in terms of data on the boundary of the spacetime, they\nreflect the physics of bulk time evolution.

In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive\ndiffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models\nfor achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or\nfewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a\nspatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal\nfeatures of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse\ndenoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer\ndenoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and\ncross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to\ngenerate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the\nproposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and\nquantitatively outperforms existing methods.
