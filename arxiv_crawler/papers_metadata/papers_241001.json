            "summary": "We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional\nquantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally\nobserved Jain states at lattice filling $\\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest\nLandau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the\ncharged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal\nmomenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant\nstates of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to\nthe vicinity of $\\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states.\nThese include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge\nmodes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with\nnon-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a\ndoping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our\nanalysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing\ninstabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling\n$2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how\nour construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\\nu =\np/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases\nincluding higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi\nliquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and\nanalyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results\nprovide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by\ncorrelations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.",

            "summary": "Sampling from high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions remains a\nfundamental challenge across domains such as statistical Bayesian inference and\nphysics-based machine learning. In this paper, we propose Annealing Flow (AF),\na continuous normalizing flow-based approach designed to sample from\nhigh-dimensional and multi-modal distributions. The key idea is to learn a\ncontinuous normalizing flow-based transport map, guided by annealing, to\ntransition samples from an easy-to-sample distribution to the target\ndistribution, facilitating effective exploration of modes in high-dimensional\nspaces. Unlike many existing methods, AF training does not rely on samples from\nthe target distribution. AF ensures effective and balanced mode exploration,\nachieves linear complexity in sample size and dimensions, and circumvents\ninefficient mixing times. We demonstrate the superior performance of AF\ncompared to state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on various\nchallenging distributions and real-world datasets, particularly in\nhigh-dimensional and multi-modal settings. We also highlight the potential of\nAF for sampling the least favorable distributions.",

The\ntreatment of two molecules as indistinguishable includes symmetrization of\nrotational wavefunctions, introduces exchange parity, and gives state-to-state\ntransition matrix elements different from those in the straightforward\ntreatment of molecules as distinguishable. Moreover, the treatment of collision\npartners as indistinguishable is eight times faster. Numerical results,\npresented for $H_2 + H_2$, CO + CO and $H_2O + H_2O$ systems, indicate good\nagreement of MQCT calculations with full-quantum calculations from literature\nand show that an a posteriori correction, applied after the treatment of\ncollision partners as distinguishable, generally produces good results that\nagree well with the rigorous treatment of collision partners as\nindistinguishable. This correction for cross section includes either\nmultiplication by 2, or summation over physically indistinguishable processes,\ndepending on the transition type. After this correction, the results of two\ntreatments agree within 5% for most but may reach 10-20% for some transitions.\nAt low collision energies dominated by scattering resonances these differences\ncan be larger, but they tend to decrease as collision energy is increased. It\nis also shown that if the system is artificially forced to follow the same\ncollision path in the indistinguishable and distinguishable treatments, then\nall differences between the results of two treatments disappear. This\ninteresting finding gives new insight into the collision process and indicates\nthat indistinguishability of identical collision partners comes into play\nthrough the collision path itself, rather than through matrix elements of\ninelastic transitions.",

Here, we derive a\nphysics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS-parametrized channels.\nRecognizing that the RIS control circuit, irrespective of its detailed\narchitecture, can always be represented as a multi-port network with auxiliary\nports terminated by tunable individual loads, we physics-compliantly express\nthe BD-RIS-parametrized channel as a multi-port chain cascade of i) radio\nenvironment, ii) static parts of the control circuit, and iii) individually\ntunable loads. Thus, the cascade of the former two systems is terminated by a\nsystem that is mathematically always characterized by a diagonal matrix. This\nphysics-compliant diagonal representation implies that existing algorithms for\nchannel estimation and optimization for conventional (\"diagonal\") RIS can be\nreadily applied to BD-RIS scenarios. We demonstrate this in an experimentally\ngrounded case study. Importantly, we highlight that, operationally, an\nambiguous characterization of the cascade of radio environment and the static\nparts of the control circuit is required, but not the breakdown into the\ncharacteristics of its two constituent systems nor the lifting of the\nambiguities. Nonetheless, we demonstrate how to derive or estimate the\ncharacteristics of the static parts of the control circuit for pedagogical\npurposes. The diagonal representation of BD-RIS-parametrized channels also\nenables their treatment with coupled-dipole-based models. We furthermore derive\nthe assumptions under which the physics-compliant BD-RIS model simplifies to\nthe widespread linear cascaded model.",

This work\ndevelops a variant of resolvent analysis applicable to time-evolving flows, and\nproposes a variant that identifies spatio-temporally sparse structures,\napplicable to either stationary or time-varying systems. Spatio-temporal\nresolvent analysis is formulated through the incorporation of the temporal\ndimension via a discrete time-differentiation operator. Sparsity (localisation)\nis achieved through the addition of an l1-norm penalisation term to the\noptimisation associated with the SVD. This modified problem can be formulated\nas a nonlinear eigenproblem, and solved via an inverse power method. We first\nshowcase the implementation of the sparse analysis on statistically-stationary\nturbulent channel flow, and demonstrate that the sparse variant can identify\naspects of the physics not directly evident from standard resolvent analysis.\nThis is followed by applying the sparse space-time formulation on systems that\nare time-varying: a time-periodic turbulent Stokes boundary layer, and then a\nturbulent channel flow with a sudden imposition of a lateral pressure gradient,\nwith the original streamwise pressure gradient unchanged. We present results\ndemonstrating how the sparsity-promoting variant can either change the\nquantitative structure of the leading space-time modes to increase their\nsparsity, or identify entirely different linear amplification mechanisms\ncompared to non-sparse resolvent analysis.",
