            "summary": "In this letter, we demonstrate how an emergent non-invertible symmetry along\na renormalization group (RG) flow reveals connections between microscopic and\nmacroscopic physics. We illustrate this using (3+1)-dimensional Adjoint QCD\nwith two flavors of Weyl fermions as an example. For the $\\mathrm{SU}(2)$ case,\nC\\'ordova and Dumitrescu proposed a non-supersymmetric deformation of the\n$\\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theory leading to dynamical abelianization, followed by\nmonopole condensation, and resulting in a confining infrared (IR) phase\ncharacterized by disjoint copies of the $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model. In this\nscenario, we point out that the abelianized phase has an emergent\nnon-invertible symmetry, which is matched with the non-invertible symmetry of\nthe IR $\\mathbb{CP}^1$ phase, associated to the Hopf solitons. This result\nillustrate how an emergent non-invertible symmetry can be used to provide a\nbridge connecting the IR solitons and their properties with the ones of\nmicroscopic degrees of freedom in gauge theories with one-form symmetries.\nMoreover, based on this insight we generalize these results to other gauge\ntheories with any number of colors, and propose a candidate for the UV baryon\noperator in all these cases.",

Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and\nmanipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit\ngate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-10]. However, the gates in these\ndemonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with\nuniversal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits.\nThis relatively slow operation will greatly extend runtimes for useful,\nlarge-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum\ncomputer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than\nshuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array\nof single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single qubit RZ\ngate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout\nof alkali-atom qubits with sub-percent loss, which boosts operational speed.\nThis technique also enables us to measure 99.73(3)% CZ fidelity with atom-loss\nevents excluded, which is a record among long lived neutral-atom qubits and\nhighlights the path to higher fidelity and error correction.

Most present convex coil optimization\ncodes use the least square winding surface method by Merkel (NESCOIL), with\nrecent improvement in conditioning, regularization , sparsity and physics\nobjectives. While elegant, the method is limited to modeling the norms of\nlinear functions in coil current.

Integrating it in the\nequilibrium optimization stage can potentially exclude equilibria with\ndifficult-to-design coils, without significantly increasing the computation\ntime per iteration. QUADCOIL finds the exact, global minimum in a large\nparameter space when possible, and otherwise finds a well-performing\napproximate global minimum.

Our conditional\ndiffusion model takes an initial pose as input, and auto-regressively generates\nsuccessive motion frames conditioned on the previous frame. Despite its\nstreamlined network architecture, which uses simple MLPs, our framework is\ncapable of generating diverse, long-horizon, and high-fidelity motion\nsequences. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of techniques for incorporating\ninteractive controls into A-MDM, such as task-oriented sampling, in-painting,\nand hierarchical reinforcement learning. These techniques enable a pre-trained\nA-MDM to be efficiently adapted for a variety of new downstream tasks. We\nconduct a comprehensive suite of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness\nof A-MDM, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art auto-regressive\nmethods.",

            "summary": "Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging technology provides the unique\nadvantage of being able to collect data regardless of weather conditions and\ntime. However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle\nnoise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. To deal with this\nchallenge, research has been conducted on translating SAR images into\noptical-like representations to aid the interpretation of SAR data.\nNevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution\nsatellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative\nAdversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and\nlow fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and\nGAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional image-to-image\ntranslation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We\nconducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and\noptical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR) images. The\nexperimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional\nDiffusion Model (CDM) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality\nmetrics.",
