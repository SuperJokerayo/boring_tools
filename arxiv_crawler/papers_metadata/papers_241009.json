            "summary": "Cavitation is a process where bubbles form and collapse within a fluid with\ndynamic, spatially varying pressure. This phenomenon can concentrate energy\ndensity by 12 orders of magnitude, creating light-emitting plasma or damaging\nnearby surfaces. A key question in cavitation theory and experiments is: what\nare the upper limits of energy density achievable through this spontaneous\nmultiscale process? Among the many physical processes at play, we focus on\nfluid compressibility, modeled using the Tait-Murnaghan equation of state for a\nhomentropic Euler fluid. We examine spherical cavities corresponding to\nexperimentally realizable sonoluminescing bubbles, whose radius changes by a\nfactor of over 100. These bubbles reach velocities exceeding the speed of sound\nof the surrounding fluid. However, all-Mach hydrodynamic solvers, such as those\nimplemented using the Basilisk software, can exhibit unphysical behavior even\nat early times when motion is nearly incompressible. To accurately capture high\nMach number motion and resolve dynamics in the sonoluminescence regime, we\nintroduced a uniform bubble approximation for the ideal gas inside the bubble.\nThis leading-order approximation clarifies the significant effects of\ncompressibility. Our results reproduce the equation-of-state-dependent\nasymptotic power-law region predicted by analytic calculations. This confirms\nour method's ability to capture high Mach number motion and suggests that the\nasymptotic regime could be experimentally observed. Convergence of this method\nis demonstrated for bubbles in both water and liquid lithium, showing that\ncompressibility slows collapse. Additionally, an outgoing shock wave in the\ncompressible fluid is resolved.",

            "summary": "The coupling of the Higgs boson to first and second generation fermions has\nyet to be measured experimentally. There still could be very large deviations\nin these couplings, as the origin of flavor is completely unknown.\nNevertheless, if Yukawa couplings are modified, especially for light\ngenerations, there are generically strong constraints from flavor-changing\nneutral currents (FCNCs). Therefore, it is imperative to understand whether\nthere exists viable UV physics consistent with current data that motivates\nfuture Higgs coupling probes. In particular, the charm-quark Yukawa is the next\nquark coupling that could be measured at the LHC if it is a few times larger\nthan the SM and compatible with flavor data. This is difficult to achieve in\nthe context of standard ansatz such as Minimal Flavor Violation. In this paper\nwe show that within the framework of Spontaneous Flavor Violation (SFV), using\na Two Higgs Doublet Model as an example, the Higgs can be sufficiently charming\nthat new LHC probes are relevant. In this charming region, we show that new\nHiggs states near the EW scale with large couplings to quarks are required,\nproviding complementary observables or new constraints on the SM Yukawa\ncouplings. The down-type SFV mechanism enabling the suppression of FCNCs also\nallows for independent modifications to the up-quark Yukawa coupling, which we\nexplore in detail as well.",

In\nsuperconducting qubit arrays, high-energy impact events produce correlated\nerrors, violating this key assumption. Following such an event, phonons with\nenergy above the superconducting gap propagate throughout the device substrate,\nwhich in turn generate a temporary surge in quasiparticle (QP) density\nthroughout the array. When these QPs tunnel across the qubits' Josephson\njunctions, they induce correlated errors. Engineering different superconducting\ngaps across the qubit's Josephson junctions provides a method to resist this\nform of QP tunneling. By fabricating all-aluminum transmon qubits with both\nstrong and weak gap engineering on the same substrate, we observe starkly\ndifferent responses during high-energy impact events. Strongly gap engineered\nqubits do not show any degradation in T1 during impact events, while weakly gap\nengineered qubits show events of correlated degradation in T1. We also show\nthat strongly gap engineered qubits are robust to QP poisoning from increasing\noptical illumination intensity, whereas weakly gap engineered qubits display\nrapid degradation in coherence.

            "summary": "This paper proposes and analyzes a robust and efficient second-order\npositivity-preserving constrained transport (PPCT) scheme for ideal\nmagnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on non-staggered Cartesian meshes. The PPCT scheme\nensures two critical physical constraints: a globally discrete divergence-free\n(DDF) condition on the magnetic field and the positivity of density and\npressure. The method is inspired by a novel splitting technique from [T.A. Dao,\nM. Nazarov and I. Tomas, J. Comput. Phys., 508:113009, 2024], which divides the\nMHD system into an Euler subsystem with steady magnetic fields and a magnetic\nsubsystem with steady density and internal energy. To achieve these\nstructure-preserving properties, the PPCT scheme combines a\npositivity-preserving (PP) finite volume method for the Euler subsystem with a\nfinite difference constrained transport (CT) method for the magnetic subsystem\nvia Strang splitting. The finite volume method employs a new PP limiter that\nretains second-order accuracy and enforces the positivity of density and\npressure, with rigorous proof provided using the geometric quasilinearization\n(GQL) approach [K. Wu and C.-W. Shu, SIAM Review, 65:1031-1073, 2023]. For the\nmagnetic subsystem, we develop an implicit finite difference CT method that\nconserves energy and maintains a globally DDF constraint. This nonlinear system\nis efficiently solved to machine precision using an iterative algorithm. Since\nthe CT method is unconditionally energy-stable and conserves steady density and\ninternal energy, the PPCT scheme requires only a mild CFL condition for the\nfinite volume method to ensure stability and the PP property. While the focus\nis on 2D cases for clarity, the extension to 3D is discussed. Several\nchallenging numerical experiments, including highly magnetized MHD jets with\nhigh Mach numbers, validate the PPCT scheme's accuracy, robustness, and high\nresolution.",

However,\ncommonly used on-policy strategies are limited by the generalization capability\nof the reward model, while off-policy approaches require large amounts of\ndifficult-to-obtain paired human-annotated data, particularly in visual\ngeneration tasks. To address the limitations of both on- and off-policy RLHF,\nwe propose a preference optimization method that aligns DMs with preferences\nwithout relying on reward models or paired human-annotated data. Specifically,\nwe introduce a Semi-Policy Preference Optimization (SePPO) method. SePPO\nleverages previous checkpoints as reference models while using them to generate\non-policy reference samples, which replace \"losing images\" in preference pairs.\nThis approach allows us to optimize using only off-policy \"winning images.\"\nFurthermore, we design a strategy for reference model selection that expands\nthe exploration in the policy space. Notably, we do not simply treat reference\nsamples as negative examples for learning. Instead, we design an anchor-based\ncriterion to assess whether the reference samples are likely to be winning or\nlosing images, allowing the model to selectively learn from the generated\nreference samples. This approach mitigates performance degradation caused by\nthe uncertainty in reference sample quality. We validate SePPO across both\ntext-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks.
