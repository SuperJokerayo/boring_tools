We provide a physical interpretation of this feature in the\ncontext of both single-particle and many-body properties of electrons on a\nlattice (\"Bloch electrons\"), namely, in terms of their density of states and\numklapp scattering rate. (In an umklapp event, the change in the momentum of\ntwo colliding electrons is equal to a reciprocal lattice vector, which gives\nrise to a finite resistivity due to electron-electron interaction.) In this\ncontext, the vanishing of an integral follows simply from the condition that\neither the density of states vanishes due to the electron energy lying outside\nthe band in which free propagation of electron waves is allowed, or that an\numklapp process is kinematically forbidden due to the Fermi surface being\nsmaller than a critical value.",

Motivated by earlier work on G\\\"odel-type\nspacetimes we investigate whether $f(Q)$ gravity admits such cosmological\nsolutions, which entail causality violation. In the coincident gauge, which is\nshown to be a legitimate gauge because the connection field equations are\nsatisfied, we find that G\\\"odel-type metrics are allowed by this modified\ngravity theory for any function $f(Q)$. As a matter of fact, out of all\nG\\\"odel-type metrics only G\\\"odel's original model is compatible with $f(Q)$\ngravity, implying violation of causality.

Leveraging\na framework introduced in PRA, 106, 032204 (2022), which formally connects\nthese two notions in general physical theories, we study their interplay. Here,\ninformation-theoretic causality is defined through a causal modelling approach.\nFirst, we improve the characterization of information-theoretic signalling as\ndefined through so-called affects relations. Specifically, we provide\nconditions for identifying redundancies in different parts of such a relation,\nintroducing techniques for causal inference in unfaithful causal models (where\nthe observable data does not \"faithfully\" reflect the causal dependences). In\nparticular, this demonstrates the possibility of causal inference using the\nabsence of signalling between certain nodes. Second, we define an\norder-theoretic property called conicality, showing that it is satisfied for\nlight cones in Minkowski space-times with $d>1$ spatial dimensions but violated\nfor $d=1$. Finally, we study the embedding of information-theoretic causal\nmodels in space-time without violating relativistic principles such as no\nsuperluminal signalling (NSS). In general, we observe that constraints imposed\nby NSS in a space-time and those imposed by purely information-theoretic causal\ninference behave differently. We then prove a correspondence between conical\nspace-times and faithful causal models: in both cases, there emerges a parallel\nbetween these two types of constraints. This indicates a connection between\ninformational and geometric notions of causality, and offers new insights for\nstudying the relations between the principles of NSS and no causal loops in\ndifferent space-time geometries and theories of information processing.",

In particular sectors, they have to be necessarily enhanced by\nall-order resummations. In the so-called semi-hard regime, large energy-type\nlogarithms spoil the perturbative convergence of the series and must be\nresummed to all orders. This resummation is a core ingredient for a correct\ndescription of the inclusive hadroproduction of a forward Higgs boson in the\nlimit of small Bjorken $x$, as well as for a precision study of inclusive\nforward emissions of a Higgs boson in association with a backward identified\nobject. A complete resummation for these processes can be achieved at the at\nnext-to-leading logarithmic accuracy thanks to the\nBalitsky-Fadin-Kuraev-Lipatov approach.
