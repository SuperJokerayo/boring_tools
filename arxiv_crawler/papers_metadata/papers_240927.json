            "summary": "Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely\nbelieved to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of\nhigh-$T_\\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been\nmade by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other\nhand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge\ncarriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical\nsystem using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify\ntwo coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in\ndifferent ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor\npairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the\ncylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the\ninterplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models'\nphases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By\ninterpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to\nquantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two\nmodels through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$\nHamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling\n$t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and\npair states on the two-dopant level.",

In this\npaper, we fill this gap combining exact equations for training dynamics,\nderived using statistical physics techniques, with optimal control methods. We\napply this approach to teacher-student models for continual learning and\nmulti-task problems, obtaining a theory for task-selection protocols maximising\nperformance while minimising forgetting. Our theoretical analysis offers\nnon-trivial yet interpretable strategies for mitigating catastrophic\nforgetting, shedding light on how optimal learning protocols can modulate\nestablished effects, such as the influence of task similarity on forgetting.\nFinally, we validate our theoretical findings on real-world data.",

Specifically, building on\nrecent work on geometric Carroll expansions of general relativity, we establish\nthat leading-order Carroll gravity, with suitable matter coupling, accurately\ndescribes well-known cosmological billiards behavior. Since the Carroll limit\nimplements the ultra-local limit off shell, this opens up the door to a wide\nrange of possible tractable applications, including spatially inhomogeneous\nsetups and the emergence of spikes at late times.

Conventional MD software\nstruggles with the balance between time cost and prediction accuracy, which\nrestricts its wider application. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deep\ngenerative models have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which aim at\nlearning dynamics of diverse molecular systems over a long timestep, enjoying\nboth universality and efficiency. Nevertheless, most current methods are\ndesigned solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of the\nunderlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies and\nforces are constantly overlooked. In this work, we propose a conditional\ngenerative model called Force-guided Bridge Matching (FBM), which learns\nfull-atom time-coarsened dynamics and targets the Boltzmann-constrained\ndistribution. With the guidance of our delicately-designed intermediate force\nfield, FBM leverages favourable physics priors into the generation process,\ngiving rise to enhanced simulations.

The experiments were designed to\nsimulate physics relevant to accretion discs and jets on laboratory scales. A\ncylindrical aluminium wire array Z pinch enclosed by return posts with an\noverall azimuthal off-set angle was driven to produce ablation plasma flows\nthat propagate inwards in a slightly off-radial trajectory, injecting mass,\nangular momentum, and confining ram pressure to a rotating plasma column on the\naxis. However, the plasma is free to expand axially, forming a collimated,\ndifferentially rotating axial jet that propagates at $\\approx 100$ km/s. The\ndensity profile of the jet corresponds to a dense shell surrounding a\nlow-density core, which is consistent with the centrifugal barrier effect being\nsustained along the jet's propagation. We show analytically that, as the\nrotating plasma accretes mass, conservation of mass and momentum implies plasma\nradial growth scaling as $r \\propto t^{1/3}$. As the characteristic moment of\ninertia increases, the rotation velocity is predicted to decrease and settle on\na characteristic value $\\approx 20$ km/s.

To\novercome these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage approach for\nconsistent and photorealistic lensless image reconstruction.
