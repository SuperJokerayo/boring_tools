Methods developed to assess their\nmagnetic configuration have primarily focused on reconstructing\nthree-dimensional representations from one-dimensional time series measurements\ntaken in situ using techniques based on the \"highly twisted magnetic flux rope\"\napproximations. However, the magnetic fields of CMEs is know to have more\ncomplicated geometries. Their structure can be quantified using measures of\nfield line topology, which have been primarily used for solar physics research.\nIn this work, we introduce a novel technique of directly quantifying the\nvarious form of magnetic helicity within a CME in the interplanetary space\nusing synthetic in situ measurements. We use a relatively simple\nthree-dimensional simulation of a CME initiated with a highly-twisted flux\nrope. We find that a significant portion of the magnetic helicity near 1~au is\ncontained in writhe and mutual helicity rather than just in twist. We discuss\nthe implications of this finding for fitting and reconstruction techniques.",

For important thermodynamic operations such as\ninformation erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic\ncost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined\nerror margin. In this study, we introduce the concept of {\\it separated\nstates}, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states. This concept\ngeneralizes many critical states involved in relevant thermodynamic operations.\nWe uncover a three-way trade-off relation between {\\it time}, {\\it cost}, and\n{\\it error} for a general class of thermodynamic operations aimed at creating\nseparated states, simply expressed as $\\tau{\\cal C}\\varepsilon_{\\tau}\\ge\n1-\\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic\noperations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a\nprofound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of\nthermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the\nquantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of\nseparated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore,\nwe extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and\nnon-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a\nsimilar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a\npure state with a given error. The generalization to general quantum dynamics\ninvolving a system coupled to a finite bath implies that heat dissipation\nbecomes infinite as the quantum system is exactly cooled down to the ground\nstate or perfectly reset to a pure state, thereby resolving an open question\nregarding the thermodynamic cost of information erasure.",

We consider particle escape from a\nquantum well generically emerging as a bifurcation in a smooth electrostatic\npotential and develop a set of analytic and numerical approximations for the\nground-state tunneling and thermally activated escape rates. These\napproximations are applied to the problem of electron capture by a closing\ntunnel barrier where the competition between the closing speed and the escape\nrate defines a scaling relation for the capture fidelity. Effective\none-dimensional cubic potential approximation leads to a universal form of this\nscaling relation in terms of device-independent dimensionless depth and speed\nparameters. Using predictions for temperature and magnetic-field dependence we\nshow how to infer the energy scales of cubic longitudinal and quadratic\ntransverse confinement. Finally, we derive an intrinsic quantum speed bound for\nadiabatic protection of the ground state tunneling and show that the latter can\npotentially be exploited up to the break down of confinement with a practical\nspeed limit set by reaching the quantum uncertainty of the barrier height\nbefore the onset of non-adiabatic excitation.

In a panel study featuring 67 measuring points\ninvolving up to 128 participants at each point, we investigated students'\nstress perceptions with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), identified\nunderlying sources of stress, and assessed self-estimated workloads across two\ndifferent cohorts. This examination occurred almost every week during the first\nsemester, and for one cohort also in the second semester, yielding a total of\n3,241 PSQ data points and 5,823 stressors. The PSQ data indicate a consistent\nstress trajectory across all three groups studied that is characterized by\nsignificant dynamics between measuring points, spanning from $M=20.1, SD=15.9$\nto $M=63.6, SD=13.4$ on a scale from 0 to 100.

Due to the\nindependent design of semantic encoders, synchronizing multimodal features in\nboth the semantic and time domains is a challenging problem. In this paper, we\ntake the facial video and speech transmission as an example and propose a\nSynchronous Multimodal Semantic Communication System (SyncSC) with Packet-Level\nCoding. To achieve semantic and time synchronization, 3D Morphable Mode (3DMM)\ncoefficients and text are transmitted as semantics, and we propose a semantic\ncodec that achieves similar quality of reconstruction and synchronization with\nlower bandwidth, compared to traditional methods. To protect semantic packets\nunder the erasure channel, we propose a packet-Level Forward Error Correction\n(FEC) method, called PacSC, that maintains a certain visual quality performance\neven at high packet loss rates. Particularly, for text packets, a text packet\nloss concealment module, called TextPC, based on Bidirectional Encoder\nRepresentations from Transformers (BERT) is proposed, which significantly\nimproves the performance of traditional FEC methods.
