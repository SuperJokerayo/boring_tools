            "summary": "Symmetry resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry are two measures of\nquantum correlations sensitive to symmetries of the system. Here we discuss\ntheir non-equilibrium dynamics in the Rule 54 cellular automaton, a simple, yet\ninteracting, integrable model. Both quantities can be expressed in terms of the\nmore analytically tractable \"charged moments\", i.e. traces of powers of a\nsuitably deformed density matrix, via a replica trick. We express them in terms\nof a tensor network, which we contract in space using a system of local\nalgebraic relations. This gives the asymptotic form for the charged moments,\nvalid in the regime of large but finite time that is shorter than all the\nrelevant subsystem sizes. In this regime the charge moments decay exponentially\nwith the rate given by the leading solution to a cubic equation.",

This is also known as Bell inequality\nviolation and is made possible by quantum entanglement. In this work, we\npresent a conceptual framework for applying quantum telepathy to real-world\nproblems. In general, the problems involve coordinating decisions given a set\nof observations without being able to communicate. We argue this inability is\nactually quite prevalent in the modern era where the decision-making timescales\nof computer processors are so short that speed of light delay is actually quite\nappreciable in comparison. We highlight the example of high-frequency trading\n(HFT), where trades are made at microsecond timescales, but the speed of light\ndelay between different exchanges can range from the order of 10 microseconds\nto 10 milliseconds. Due to the maturity of Bell inequality violation\nexperiments, experimental realization of quantum telepathy schemes that can\nattain a quantum advantage for real-world problems $\\textit{is already almost\nimmediately possible}$. We demonstrate this by conducting a case study for a\nconcrete HFT scenario that gives rise to a generalization of the CHSH game and\nevaluate different possible physical implementations for achieving a quantum\nadvantage. It is well known that Bell inequality violation is a rigorous\nmathematical proof of a quantum advantage over any classical strategy and does\nnot need any complexity-theoretic assumptions such as\n$\\text{BQP}\\neq\\text{BPP}$.
