            "summary": "The enduring legacy of Euclidean geometry underpins classical machine\nlearning, which, for decades, has been primarily developed for data lying in\nEuclidean space. Yet, modern machine learning increasingly encounters richly\nstructured data that is inherently nonEuclidean. This data can exhibit\nintricate geometric, topological and algebraic structure: from the geometry of\nthe curvature of space-time, to topologically complex interactions between\nneurons in the brain, to the algebraic transformations describing symmetries of\nphysical systems. Extracting knowledge from such non-Euclidean data\nnecessitates a broader mathematical perspective. Echoing the 19th-century\nrevolutions that gave rise to non-Euclidean geometry, an emerging line of\nresearch is redefining modern machine learning with non-Euclidean structures.\nIts goal: generalizing classical methods to unconventional data types with\ngeometry, topology, and algebra. In this review, we provide an accessible\ngateway to this fast-growing field and propose a graphical taxonomy that\nintegrates recent advances into an intuitive unified framework. We subsequently\nextract insights into current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities\nfor future development in this field.",

Here we demonstrate direct electrical detection of\nantiferromagnetic resonance in devices 1000 times smaller using spin-filter\ntunneling in micron-scale PtTe$_2$/bilayer CrSBr/graphite junctions in which\nthe tunnel barrier is the van der Waals antiferromaget CrSBr. This sample\ngeometry allows not only efficient detection, but also electrical control of\nthe antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe$_2$\nelectrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic\nresonance provides the means to make detailed studies of the physics governing\nthese high-frequency dynamics and to pursue applications including radiation\nsources, modulators, and detectors.",

            "summary": "To each complex saddle point of an action, one can attach a Lefschetz thimble\non which the imaginary part of the action is constant. Cauchy theorem states\nthat summation over a set of thimbles produces the exact result. This\nreorganization of the path integral, is an appealing starting point for various\napproximations: In the realm of auxiliary quantum Monte Carlo methods it\nprovides a framework to alleviate the negative sign problem. Here, we suggest\nto constrain the integration to the \\textit{dominant} thimbles: the thimbles\nattached to the saddle points with the largest statistical weight. For the\nHubbard model, in a formulation where the the Hubbard Stratonovitch field\ncouples to the charge, this provides a \\textit{symmetry} consistent\napproximation to the physics of the Hubbard model: constraining the integration\ndomain does not explicitly break a symmetry. We can test this approach for the\nHubbard model at half-filling on a bipartite lattice. The paper builds on the\npreviously developed instanton gas approach, where an exhaustive saddle point\napproximation was constructed. We present results, showing that the dominant\nthimbles approximation provides results that are in remarkable agreement with\nthe exact results for various fermionic observables including spin and charge\norder parameters and single electron spectral functions. We discuss\nimplications of our results for simulations away of half filling.",

            "summary": "Many microorganisms are capable of swimming through viscous fluids such as\nwater in order to search for nutrients, swim toward oxygen or light, or to\nescape from predators. To navigate their environment they often perform large\nnonreciprocal periodic deformations of their shape, by waving appendages such\nas cilia or flagella, or by deforming their entire body. Even unicellular\norganisms are fundamentally made of parts, which need to be cooperatively\nutilized to allow these creatures to navigate their environment, without using\na centralized control mechanism. Here, we investigate the physical implications\nof decentralized decision-making of the actuators of a generalized N-bead\nNajafi Golestanian microswimmer, self-propelling via coordinated non-reciprocal\nswimming strokes. We treat each bead as an artificial neural network-based\nagent that perceives information about its neighbors and whose actions induce\nstrokes of its adjacent arms. With neuroevolution techniques, we evolve optimal\npolicies for the single-bead decision centers such that the N-bead collective\nefficiently self-propels as an individual, allowing us to investigate optimal\nlocomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies. We demonstrate\nthat such decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning\nmorphological changes or defects and facilitate cargo transport or drug\ndelivery applications \"out of the box\", without further optimization. Our\napproach allows us to train large swimmers ($N=100$ and more), and we show that\nlong-wavelength solutions lead to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. Our\nwork is of relevance to understand robust locomotion of biological\nmicroswimmers, to develop robust artificial microswimmer navigation strategies,\nand, in a broader conceptional context, for Artificial Life< and in general\nemergent levels of individuality.",

These novel material platforms have been\ndemonstrated to host periodic arrays of excitonic quantum emitters, interlayer\nexcitons with long lifetimes, and exotic many-body states. While much remains\nto be known and understood about these heterostructures, the field of\nhigh-angle, incommensurate bilayers is even less explored. At twist angles\nlarger than a few degrees, the presence of periodicity in these bilayers\nbecomes chaotic, making the systems essentially aperiodic and incommensurate in\nnature due to the limitations of fabrication techniques. In this work, we\ndemonstrate the emergence of a brightened dark intralayer exciton in twisted\nmolybdenum diselenide homobilayer. We show that this dark exciton diffuses\nacross the excitation spot more efficiently as compared to trions or excitons,\nreaching diffusion lengths greater than 4 microns.

This in turn\ncalls for a generalized loop line element (= distance$^2$ between two\nneighboring loops) capable of restoring, at the shrinking loop limit, the\nspecial relativistic line element (= distance$^2$ between the two neighboring\ncenters-of-mass, respectively). Sticking at first stage to a flat\nEuclidean/Minkowski background, one is led to such a preliminary loop line\nelement, where the role of coordinates is played by the oriented cross-sections\nprojected by the loop event. Such cross-sections are generically center-of-mass\nindependent, unless (owing to a topological term) the loop events are\nintrinsically wrapped around a Kaluza-Klein like compact fifth dimension.\nSerendipitously, it is the Kaluza-Klein ingredient which, on top of its\ntraditional assignments, is shown to govern the extension of Pythagoras theorem\nto loop space. Associated with $M_4 \\otimes S_1$ is then a 10-dim loop\nspacetime metric, whose 4-dim center-of-mass core term is supplemented by a\n6-dim Maxwell-style fine structure. The imperative inclusion of a positive (say\nNambu-Goto) string tension within the framework of Loop Special Relativity is\nfingerprinted by a low periodicity breathing mode.

Yet their stochastic nature hinders artists from creating\nconsistent images of the same subject. Existing methods try to tackle this\nchallenge and generate consistent content in various ways.

It efficiently performs consistent subject generation solely driven\nby prompts via a learned semantic guidance to bypass the laborious backbone\ntuning. We lead the way to formalize the objective of consistent subject\ngeneration from a clustering perspective, and thus design a cluster-conditioned\nmodel. To mitigate the overfitting challenge shared by one-shot tuning\npipelines, we augment the tuning with auxiliary samples and devise two\ninference strategies: semantic interpolation and cluster guidance. These\ntechniques are later verified to significantly enhance the generation quality.\nComprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms a variety of\nbaselines with satisfactory subject consistency, superior prompt conformity as\nwell as high image quality. Our method is capable of multi-subject generation\nand compatible with popular diffusion extensions. Besides, we achieve a 4 times\nfaster tuning speed than tuning-based baselines and, if desired, avoid\nincreasing inference time. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, we are the first\nto prove that the semantic space of the diffusion model has the same\ninterpolation property as the latent space does.
