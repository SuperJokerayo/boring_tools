            "summary": "Estimation of the Fisher Information Metric (FIM-estimation) is an important\ntask that arises in unsupervised learning of phase transitions, a problem\nproposed by physicists. This work completes the definition of the task by\ndefining rigorous evaluation metrics distMSE, distMSEPS, and distRE and\nintroduces ClassiFIM, a novel machine learning method designed to solve the\nFIM-estimation task. Unlike existing methods for unsupervised learning of phase\ntransitions, ClassiFIM directly estimates a well-defined quantity (the FIM),\nallowing it to be rigorously compared to any present and future other methods\nthat estimate the same. ClassiFIM transforms a dataset for the FIM-estimation\ntask into a dataset for an auxiliary binary classification task and involves\nselecting and training a model for the latter. We prove that the output of\nClassiFIM approaches the exact FIM in the limit of infinite dataset size and\nunder certain regularity conditions. We implement ClassiFIM on multiple\ndatasets, including datasets describing classical and quantum phase\ntransitions, and find that it achieves a good ground truth approximation with\nmodest computational resources. Furthermore, we independently implement two\nalternative state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised estimation of phase\ntransition locations on the same datasets and find that ClassiFIM predicts such\nlocations at least as well as these other methods. To emphasize the generality\nof our method, we also propose and generate the MNIST-CNN dataset, which\nconsists of the output of CNNs trained on MNIST for different hyperparameter\nchoices. Using ClassiFIM on this dataset suggests there is a phase transition\nin the distribution of image-prediction pairs for CNNs trained on MNIST,\ndemonstrating the broad scope of FIM-estimation beyond physics.",

This effect has raised a great curiosity since\nlong time and has been studied extensively in many classical and quantum\nsystems. Here it is shown that the Mpemba effect can be observed in optics as\nwell. Specifically, the process of light diffusion in finite-sized photonic\nlattices under incoherent (dephasing) dynamics is considered. Rather\nsurprisingly, it is shown that certain highly-localized initial light\ndistributions can diffuse faster than initial broadly delocalized\ndistributions.

            "summary": "The traditional Chern-Simons (CS) terms in 3+1 dimensions that modify General\nRelativity (GR), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and Quantum Electrodynamics\n(QED), typically lack scale invariance. However, a locally scale invariant and\ngeodesically complete framework for the Standard Model (SM) coupled to GR was\npreviously constructed by employing a tailored form of local scale (Weyl)\nsymmetry. This refined SM+GR model closely resembles the conventional SM in\nsubatomic realms where gravitational effects are negligible. Nevertheless, it\noffers an intriguing prediction: the emergence of new physics beyond the\ntraditional SM and GR near spacetime singularities, characterized by intense\ngravity and substantial deviations in the Higgs field. In this study, we expand\nupon the enhanced SM+GR by incorporating Weyl invariant CS terms for gravity,\nQCD, and QED in 3+1 dimensions, thereby integrating CS contributions within the\nlocally scale-invariant and geodesically complete paradigm. Additionally, we\nestablish a holographic correspondence between the new CS terms in 3+1\ndimensions and novel 4+2 dimensional CS-type actions within 2T-physics. We\ndemonstrate that the Weyl transformation in 3+1 dimensions arises from 4+2\ngeneral coordinate transformations, which unify the hidden extra 1+1 large (not\ncurled up) dimensions with the evident 3+1 dimensions. By leveraging the\nnewfound local conformal symmetry, the augmented and geodesically complete\nSM+GR+CS introduces innovative tools and perspectives for exploring classical\nfield theory aspects of black hole and cosmological singularities in 3+1\ndimensions, while the 4+2 dimensional connection unveils deeper facets of\nspacetime.",
