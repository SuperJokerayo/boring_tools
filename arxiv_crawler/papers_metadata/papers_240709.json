Explicit analytic results for the unpolarized and polarized\n$H^\\ast\\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow\n\\overline{\\ell}_1\\ell_1\\overline{\\ell}_2\\ell_2$ square amplitudes and the\nfour-body phase space are presented, out of which several observable quantities\ncan be obtained straightforwardly. As far as the numerical analysis is\nconcerned, a cross-check is performed via \\texttt{MadGraph5\\_aMC@NLO}, where\nour model was implemented with the aid of FeynRules. We then consider the most\nstringent bounds on anomalous complex $H^*ZZ$ couplings and analyze the effects\nof the polarizations of the $Z$ gauge bosons through the polarized\n$H^\\ast\\rightarrow ZZ \\rightarrow\n\\overline{\\ell}_1\\ell_1\\overline{\\ell}_2\\ell_2$ decay width as well as\nleft-right and forward-backward asymmetries, which are found to be sensitive to\nnew-physics effects. Particular focus is put on the effects of the absorptive\nparts of the anomalous $H^*ZZ$ couplings, which have been largely overlooked up\nto now in LHC analyses. It is found that the studied observable quantities,\nparticularly the left-right asymmetries, can be helpful to look for effects of\n$CP$-violation in the $H^*ZZ$ coupling and set bounds on the absorptive parts.\nFor completeness, we also analyze the case of unpolarized $Z$ gauge bosons.",

            "summary": "Prolonged contact between a corrosive liquid and metal alloys can cause\nprogressive dealloying. For such liquid-metal dealloying (LMD) process, phase\nfield models have been developed. However, the governing equations often\ninvolve coupled non-linear partial differential equations (PDE), which are\nchallenging to solve numerically. In particular, stiffness in the PDEs requires\nan extremely small time steps (e.g. $10^{-12}$ or smaller). This computational\nbottleneck is especially problematic when running LMD simulation until a late\ntime horizon is required. This motivates the development of surrogate models\ncapable of leaping forward in time, by skipping several consecutive time steps\nat-once. In this paper, we propose U-Shaped Adaptive Fourier Neural Operators\n(U-AFNO), a machine learning (ML) model inspired by recent advances in neural\noperator learning. U-AFNO employs U-Nets for extracting and reconstructing\nlocal features within the physical fields, and passes the latent space through\na vision transformer (ViT) implemented in the Fourier space (AFNO). We use\nU-AFNOs to learn the dynamics mapping the field at a current time step into a\nlater time step. We also identify global quantities of interest (QoI)\ndescribing the corrosion process (e.g. the deformation of the liquid-metal\ninterface) and show that our proposed U-AFNO model is able to accurately\npredict the field dynamics, in-spite of the chaotic nature of LMD. Our model\nreproduces the key micro-structure statistics and QoIs with a level of accuracy\non-par with the high-fidelity numerical solver. We also investigate the\nopportunity of using hybrid simulations, in which we alternate forward leap in\ntime using the U-AFNO with high-fidelity time stepping. We demonstrate that\nwhile advantageous for some surrogate model design choices, our proposed U-AFNO\nmodel in fully auto-regressive settings consistently outperforms hybrid\nschemes.",

            "summary": "While many previous studies have indicated that encouraging a growth mindset\ncan improve student learning outcomes, this conclusion's applicability to\ncollege-level astronomy classrooms remains poorly understood owing to the\nvariation in students' overall and domain-specific learning attitudes. To\naddress this, we surveyed undergraduate students in an introductory astronomy\nclass about their attitudes towards learning astronomy over the course of five\nsemesters. Overall, students felt an affinity for astronomy, felt moderately\ncompetent, perceived astronomy to be intermediate in terms of difficulty, and\nagreed strongly with standard statements reflecting a \"growth mindset,\" i.e.,\nthe belief that intelligence is malleable rather than fixed from birth. Their\nresponses were stable over the course of the semester and did not appear to\ndepend strongly on student demographics. The unexpected start of the COVID-19\npandemic and the associated shift to all-virtual learning correlated with a\ndrop in their affinity for astronomy, a small decrease in their perceived\ncompetence, and an increase in the perceived difficulty of the topic. Their\noverall learning mindset showed negligible change during this time, emphasizing\nthe stability of their belief in a growth mindset as compared to other measured\nlearning attitudes. However, more nuanced questions about their behaviors and\ninterpretations in the classroom, about how they felt \"in the moment\", and\nabout what factors were most important for their success in the class revealed\nsignificantly lower alignment with a growth mindset. This suggests that while\nintroductory astronomy students may believe that they have a growth mindset,\nthis mindset is not necessarily reflected in their self-reported classroom\nbehaviors or measured responses to actual learning challenges.",

These processes are not scale-invariant\nin general, but they do enjoy a natural domain Markov property thanks to the\nstationary independent increments of Levy processes. The associated Loewner\nhulls feature remarkably intricate topological properties and possibly\ncomplicated multifractal phenomena, of which very little is known rigorously.\n  We prove that a chordal Loewner chain driven by a Levy process $W$ satisfying\nmild regularity conditions (including stable processes) is a.s. generated by a\ncadlag curve. Specifically, if the diffusivity parameter of the driving process\n$W$ is $\\kappa \\in [0,8)$, then the jump measure of $W$ is required to be\nlocally (upper) Ahlfors regular near the origin, while if $\\kappa > 8$, no\nconstraints are imposed. In particular, we show that the associated Loewner\nhulls are a.s. locally connected and path-connected. We also show that, the\ncomplements of the hulls are a.s. Holder domains when $\\kappa \\neq 4$ (which is\nnot expected to hold when $\\kappa=4$), without any regularity assumptions. The\nproofs of these results mainly rely on careful derivative estimates for both\nthe forward and backward Loewner maps obtained using delicate but robust enough\nsupermartingale domination arguments. As one cannot control the jump\naccumulation of general Levy processes, we must circumvent all reasoning that\nwould use continuity. To prove the local connectedness, we use an extension of\npart of the Hahn-Mazurkiewicz theorem: hulls generated by cadlag curves are\nlocally connected even when jumps would occur at infinite intensity.",

In this work, we explore\ntwo methods of machine learning -- a tree-based classifier and a\ngraph-convolutional neural network -- to improve rejection of fast\nneutron-induced background events in a water Cherenkov detector.

Moreover, we present a novel Capsule-endoscopy Exposure Correction\n(CEC) dataset, including ground-truth and corrupted image pairs annotated by\nexpert photographers. Extensive experiments against a variety of\nstate-of-the-art (SOTA) methods on four datasets showcase the effectiveness of\nour proposed method and components in WCE illumination restoration, and the\nadditional downstream experiments further demonstrate its utility for clinical\ndiagnosis and surgical assistance.",

            "summary": "Graph anomaly detection (GAD) has been widely applied in many areas, e.g.,\nfraud detection in finance and robot accounts in social networks. Existing\nmethods are dedicated to identifying the outlier nodes that deviate from normal\nones. While they heavily rely on high-quality annotation, which is hard to\nobtain in real-world scenarios, this could lead to severely degraded\nperformance based on noisy labels. Thus, we are motivated to cut the edges of\nsuspicious nodes to alleviate the impact of noise. However, it remains\ndifficult to precisely identify the nodes with noisy labels. Moreover, it is\nhard to quantitatively evaluate the regret of cutting the edges, which may have\neither positive or negative influences. To this end, we propose a novel\nframework REGAD, i.e., REinforced Graph Anomaly Detector. Specifically, we aim\nto maximize the performance improvement (AUC) of a base detector by cutting\nnoisy edges approximated through the nodes with high-confidence labels. (i) We\ndesign a tailored action and search space to train a policy network to\ncarefully prune edges step by step, where only a few suspicious edges are\nprioritized in each step. (ii) We design a policy-in-the-loop mechanism to\niteratively optimize the policy based on the feedback from base detector. The\noverall performance is evaluated by the cumulative rewards. Extensive\nexperiments are conducted on three datasets under different anomaly ratios. The\nresults indicate the superior performance of our proposed REGAD.",
