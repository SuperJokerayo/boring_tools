            "summary": "Massive particles produced during inflation impact soft limits of primordial\ncorrelators. Searching for these signatures presents an exciting opportunity to\nuncover the particle spectrum in the inflationary epoch. We present\nnon-perturbative methods to constrain intermediate-mass scalars ($0\\leq\nm/H<3/2$, where $H$ is the inflationary Hubble scale) produced during\ninflation, which give rise to a power-law scaling in the squeezed primordial\nbispectrum. Exploiting the large-scale structure consistency relations and the\nseparate universe approach, we derive models for the late-time squeezed matter\nbispectrum and collapsed matter trispectrum sourced by these fields. To\nvalidate our models, we run $N$-body simulations with the \"Cosmological\nCollider\" squeezed bispectrum for two different particle masses. Our models\nyield unbiased constraints on the amplitude of non-Gaussianity, $f_{\\rm\nNL}^{\\Delta}$, from the squeezed bispectrum and collapsed trispectrum deep into\nthe non-linear regime ($k_{\\rm max}\\approx 2~h/{\\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0$). We assess\nthe information content of these summary statistics, emphasizing the importance\nof sample variance cancellation in the matter sector. We also study the\nscale-dependent halo bias in our simulations. For mass-selected halos, the\nnon-Gaussian bias estimated from our simulations agrees with predictions based\non (i) separate universe simulations and (ii) universal mass functions. With\nfurther work, these results can be used to search for inflationary massive\nparticle production with upcoming galaxy surveys.",

            "summary": "One of the most counterintuitive aspects of quantum theory is its claim that\nthere is 'intrinsic' randomness in the physical world. Quantum information\nscience has greatly progressed in the study of intrinsic, or secret, quantum\nrandomness in the past decade. With much emphasis on device-independent and\nsemi-device-independent bounds, one of the most basic questions has escaped\nattention: how much intrinsic randomness can be extracted from a given state\n$\\rho$, and what measurements achieve this bound? We answer this question for\nthree different randomness quantifiers: the conditional min-entropy, the\nconditional von Neumann entropy and the conditional max-entropy. For the first,\nwe solve the min-max problem of finding the projective measurement that\nminimises the maximal guessing probability of an eavesdropper. The result is\nthat one can guarantee an amount of conditional min-entropy\n$H^*_{\\textrm{min}}=-\\log_2 P_{\\textrm{guess}}^{*}(\\rho)$ with\n$P_{\\textrm{guess}}^{*}(\\rho)=\\frac{1}{d}(\\textrm{tr} \\sqrt{\\rho})^2$ by\nperforming suitable projective measurements. For the conditional von Neumann\nentropy, we find that the maximal value is $H^{*}= \\log_{2}d-S(\\rho)$, with\n$S(\\rho)$ the von Neumann entropy of $\\rho$, while for the conditional\nmax-entropy, we find the maximal value $H^{*}_\\textrm{max}=\\log_{2}d +\n\\log_{2}\\lambda_{\\textrm{max}}(\\rho)$, where $\\lambda_{\\textrm{max}}(\\rho)$ is\nthe largest eigenvalue of $\\rho$. Optimal values for $H^{*}_{\\textrm{min}}$,\n$H^{*}$ and $H^{*}_\\textrm{max}$ are achieved by measuring in any basis that is\nunbiased to the eigenbasis of $\\rho$, as well as by other, less intuitive,\nmeasurements.",

To address this issue, this\npaper introduces a method that improves the design feasibility by prompting the\ngeneration with feasible CAD images. In this work, the usefulness of this\nmethod is investigated through a case study with a bike design task using an\noff-the-shelf text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion 2.1. A diverse set of bike\ndesigns are produced in seven different generation settings with varying CAD\nimage prompting weights, and these designs are evaluated on their perceived\nfeasibility and novelty. Results demonstrate that the CAD image prompting\nsuccessfully helps text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion 2.1 create\nvisibly more feasible design images. While a general tradeoff is observed\nbetween feasibility and novelty, when the prompting weight is kept low around\n0.35, the design feasibility is significantly improved while its novelty\nremains on par with those generated by text prompts alone. The insights from\nthis case study offer some guidelines for selecting the appropriate CAD image\nprompting weight for different stages of the engineering design process.
