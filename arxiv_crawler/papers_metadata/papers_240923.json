The system changes from an area law entangled phase\nin the permutation symmetric subspace where collective variables exist to\nvolume law entanglement in the full Hilbert space, beyond a critical strength\nof the disorder. The critical strength tends to zero when the original disorder\nfree system is fully chaotic. We study this mainly via the scaling of the\ncollective spin of non-equilibrium states which transit to have properties of\nwhat has been dubbed \"deep Hilbert space\". This has potential implications for\ngeneral many body physics, as well as technologies such as transmon qubits.",

Often, the resolution of these physics challenges\nis computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in\nterms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the\nphysical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or\nminimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the\nphysics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of\nfreedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within\nthe functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which\naccommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state.\n  In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed\nrenormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate\ntransformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective\nflows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions,\nformulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG\nflows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational\napplications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the\ndynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the\nmost rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational\neffort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a\ngiven expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content\nwithin a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows\ncan be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows\nwithin a given approximation.",
