Initially, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system,\nincluding entropy, heat capacity, and Hawking radiation. For the latter\nquantity, we employ two distinct methods: surface gravity and the topological\napproach. Additionally, we examine the emission rate and remnant mass within\nthis context. Remarkably, the lifetime of the black hole, after reaching its\nfinal state due to the evaporation process, is expressed analytically up to a\ngrey-body factor. We estimate the lifetime for specific initial and final mass\nconfigurations. Also, we analyze the tensorial quasinormal modes using the\n6th-order WKB method. Finally, we study the deflection angle, i.e.,\ngravitational lensing, in both the weak and strong deflection limits.",

            "summary": "Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the 3D physical world\nremains a significant challenge. Due to the lack of large-scale 3D-text pair\ndatasets, the success of LLMs has yet to be replicated in 3D understanding. In\nthis paper, we rethink this issue and propose a new task: 3D Data-Efficient\nPoint-Language Understanding. The goal is to enable LLMs to achieve robust 3D\nobject understanding with minimal 3D point cloud and text data pairs. To\naddress this task, we introduce GreenPLM, which leverages more text data to\ncompensate for the lack of 3D data. First, inspired by using CLIP to align\nimages and text, we utilize a pre-trained point cloud-text encoder to map the\n3D point cloud space to the text space. This mapping leaves us to seamlessly\nconnect the text space with LLMs. Once the point-text-LLM connection is\nestablished, we further enhance text-LLM alignment by expanding the\nintermediate text space, thereby reducing the reliance on 3D point cloud data.\nSpecifically, we generate 6M free-text descriptions of 3D objects, and design a\nthree-stage training strategy to help LLMs better explore the intrinsic\nconnections between different modalities. To achieve efficient modality\nalignment, we design a zero-parameter cross-attention module for token pooling.\nExtensive experimental results show that GreenPLM requires only 12% of the 3D\ntraining data used by existing state-of-the-art models to achieve superior 3D\nunderstanding. Remarkably, GreenPLM also achieves competitive performance using\ntext-only data. The code and weights are available at:\nhttps://github.com/TangYuan96/GreenPLM.",

Recent experimental development of trapping\nand controlling two-species atoms using optical tweezer arrays has brought more\ncomplex interactions in this game, enabling much versatile novel quantum states\nand phenomena to emerge and thus leading to a growing need for both theoretical\nand numerical investigations in this regard. In this paper we systematically\ncalculate the ground state phase diagram of alternating two-species atom array\nand find some novel quantum states that cannot exist in traditional cold-atom\nplatforms, for instance the period $4$ product state $|1100\\rangle^{\\otimes\nm}$, the period $6$ product state $|111000\\rangle^{\\otimes m}$ and\norder-disorder separation phase. We also confirm the existence of floating\nphase, however, in this system it has to be described by two interacting\nbosonic fields whereas that in the single species Rydberg atom array can be\nunderstood as free bosons. More interestingly, in the quench dynamics we\ndiscover a type of new quantum many-body scar distinct from that previous found\nin single species atoms which is explained by low-energy effective theory of\nthe PXP model. Instead, the underlying physics of the newly found quantum\nmany-body scar can be described by a perturbation theory spanning the whole\nenergy spectrum. Detailed analysis on how to experimentally prepare these\nstates and observe the phenomena is provided. Numerical evidence shows that the\nproposed scheme is robust against typical experimentally relevent imperfections\nand thus it is implementable. Our work opens new avenue for quantum simulating\nnovel quantum many-body states both in and out of equilibrium arising from the\ninterplay of competing interactions of different atom species and quantum\nfluctuations.",

We\nintroduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced\ndistortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it\ntravels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the\nintrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the\n2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by\nIceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or\n10^9 GeV (quadratic).

To\nachieve accurate generation, MODULI introduces two return normalization methods\nunder diverse preferences for refining guidance. To further enhance\ngeneralization to OOD preferences, MODULI proposes a novel sliding guidance\nmechanism, which involves training an additional slider adapter to capture the\ndirection of preference changes.
