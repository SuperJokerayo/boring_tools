            "authors": "Defne E. Ozan, Luca Magri",
            "summary": "Adjoint methods have been the pillar of gradient-based optimization for\ndecades. They enable the accurate computation of a gradient (sensitivity) of a\nquantity of interest with respect to all system's parameters in one\ncalculation. When the gradient is embedded in an optimization routine, the\nquantity of interest can be optimized for the system to have the desired\nbehaviour. Adjoint methods require the system's governing equations and their\nJacobian. We propose a computational strategy to infer the adjoint\nsensitivities from data when the governing equations might be unknown (or\npartly unknown), and noise might be present. The key component of this strategy\nis an echo state network, which learns the dynamics of nonlinear regimes with\nvarying parameters, and evolves dynamically via a hidden state. Although the\nframework is general, we focus on thermoacoustics governed by nonlinear and\ntime-delayed systems. First, we show that a parameter-aware Echo State Network\n(ESN) infers the parameterized dynamics. Second, we derive the adjoint of the\nESN to compute the sensitivity to parameters and initial conditions. Third, we\npropose the Thermoacoustic Echo State Network (T-ESN), which embeds the\nphysical knowledge in the network architecture. Fourth, we apply the framework\nto a variety of nonlinear thermoacoustic regimes of a prototypical system. We\nshow that the T-ESN accurately infers the correct adjoint sensitivities of the\ntime-averaged acoustic energy with respect to the flame parameters. The results\nare robust to noisy data, from periodic, through quasiperiodic, to chaotic\nregimes. A single network predicts the nonlinear bifurcations on unseen\nscenarios, and so the inferred adjoint sensitivities are employed to suppress\nan instability via steepest descent. This work opens new possibilities for\ngradient-based data-driven design optimization.",

Notably, charge transfer\nat the interface between two insulating oxide layers can lead to the formation\nof a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with possible applications in, e.g.,\nhigh-electronmobility transistors and ferroelectric field-effect transistors.\nSo far, the realization of oxide 2DEGs is, however, largely limited to the\ninterface between the single-crystal substrate and epitaxial film, preventing\ntheir deliberate placement inside a larger device architecture. Additionally,\nthe substrate-limited quality of perovskite oxide interfaces hampers\nroom-temperature 2DEG performance due to notoriously low electron mobility. In\nthis work, we demonstrate the controlled creation of an interfacial 2DEG at the\nepitaxial interface between perovskite oxides BaSnO$_3$ and LaInO$_3$ with\nenhanced room-temperature electron mobilities up to 119 cm$^2$/Vs - the highest\nroom-temperature value reported so far for a perovskite oxide 2DEG. Using a\ncombination of state-of-the-art deposition modes during oxide molecular beam\nepitaxy, our approach opens up another degree of freedom in optimization and\n$in$-$situ$ control of the interface between two epitaxial oxide layers away\nfrom the substrate interface. We thus expect our approach to apply to the\ngeneral class of perovskite oxide 2DEG systems and to enable their improved\ncompatibility with novel device concepts and integration across materials\nplatforms.",

            "summary": "The field of neural quantum states has recently experienced a tremendous\nprogress, making them a competitive tool of computational quantum many-body\nphysics. However, their largest achievements to date mostly concern interacting\nspin systems, while their utility for quantum chemistry remains yet to be\ndemonstrated. Two main complications are the peaked structure of the molecular\nwave functions, which impedes sampling, and large number of terms in second\nquantised Hamiltonians, which hinders scaling to larger molecule sizes. In this\npaper we address these issues jointly and argue that the peaked structure might\nactually be key to drastically more efficient calculations. Specifically, we\nintroduce a novel algorithm for autoregressive sampling without replacement and\na procedure to calculate a computationally cheaper surrogate for the local\nenergy. We complement them with a custom modification of the stochastic\nreconfiguration optimisation technique and a highly optimised GPU\nimplementation. As a result, our calculations require substantially less\nresources and exhibit more than order of magnitude speedup compared to the\nprevious works. On a single GPU we study molecules comprising up to 118 qubits\nand outperform the ``golden standard'' CCSD(T) benchmark in Hilbert spaces of\n$\\sim 10^{15}$ Slater determinants, which is orders of magnitude larger than\nwhat was previously achieved. We believe that our work underscores the prospect\nof NQS for challenging quantum chemistry calculations and serves as a\nfavourable ground for the future method development.",

Here, we predict unconventional\nquantum optical behaviors of quantum emitters coupled to a non-Hermitian\ntopological bath, which is realized in a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic chain\nsubjected to nonlocal dissipation. In addition to the Hermitian-like chiral\nbound states in the middle line gap and skin-mode-like hidden bound states\ninside the point gap, we identify peculiar in-gap chiral and extended\nphoton-emitter dressed states. This is due to the competition of\ntopological-edge localization and non-Hermitian skin-mode localization in\ncombination with the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, when\ntwo emitters are coupled to the same bath, such in-gap dressed states can\nmediate the nonreciprocal long-range emitter-emitter interactions, with the\ninteraction range limited only by the dissipation of the bath.

Although GAN-based\nmethods have shown their strength in fast waveform generation, they are\nvulnerable to train-inference mismatch scenarios such as two-stage\ntext-to-speech. Meanwhile, diffusion-based models have shown their powerful\ngenerative performance in other domains; however, they stay out of the\nlimelight due to slow inference speed in waveform generation tasks. Above all,\nthere is no generator architecture that can explicitly disentangle the natural\nperiodic features of high-resolution waveform signals. In this paper, we\npropose PeriodWave, a novel universal waveform generation model. First, we\nintroduce a period-aware flow matching estimator that can capture the periodic\nfeatures of the waveform signal when estimating the vector fields.\nAdditionally, we utilize a multi-period estimator that avoids overlaps to\ncapture different periodic features of waveform signals. Although increasing\nthe number of periods can improve the performance significantly, this requires\nmore computational costs. To reduce this issue, we also propose a single\nperiod-conditional universal estimator that can feed-forward parallel by\nperiod-wise batch inference. Additionally, we utilize discrete wavelet\ntransform to losslessly disentangle the frequency information of waveform\nsignals for high-frequency modeling, and introduce FreeU to reduce the\nhigh-frequency noise for waveform generation.

The appropriate selection of a font can significantly enhance\nartwork and endow advertisements with a higher level of expressivity. Despite\nthe availability of numerous diverse font designs online, traditional\nretrieval-based methods for font selection are increasingly being supplanted by\ngeneration-based approaches. These newer methods offer enhanced flexibility,\ncatering to specific user preferences and capturing unique stylistic\nimpressions. However, current impression font techniques based on Generative\nAdversarial Networks (GANs) necessitate the utilization of multiple auxiliary\nlosses to provide guidance during generation. Furthermore, these methods\ncommonly employ weighted summation for the fusion of impression-related\nkeywords. This leads to generic vectors with the addition of more impression\nkeywords, ultimately lacking in detail generation capacity. In this paper, we\nintroduce a diffusion-based method, termed \\ourmethod, to generate fonts that\nvividly embody specific impressions, utilizing an input consisting of a single\nletter and a set of descriptive impression keywords.
