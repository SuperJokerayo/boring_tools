            "summary": "Density matrices are the most general descriptions of quantum states,\ncovering both pure and mixed states. Positive semidefiniteness is a physical\nrequirement of density matrices, imposing nonnegative probabilities of\nmeasuring physical values. Separately, nonlocality is a property shared by some\nbipartite quantum systems, indicating a correlation of the component parts that\ncannot be described by local classical variables. In this work, we show that\nbreaking the positive-semidefinite requirement and allowing states with a\nnegative minimal eigenvalue arbitrarily close to zero, allows for the\nconstruction of states that are nonlocal under one component labelling but\nlocal when the labelling is interchanged. This is an observer-dependent\nnonlocality, showing the connection between nonlocal objectivism and negative\nquasi-probabilities.",

            "summary": "The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently\ndescribed using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions\nbetween light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier,\ninterband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive\nindex is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional\nmeasurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more\ninformation compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance\nand transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to\nuniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to\ninterpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of\nfreedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of\noscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood\ntemperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational\nresonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from\nroom temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at\ndifferent temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and\nthen confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the\ntemperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this\ntechnique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material\nmodels describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different\ngrades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared\noptical components such as thermal emitters.",

We find that agents have a\ncritical memory depth below which complete ideology polarization of the\ncollective cannot occur and above which it is inevitable. However, depending on\nthe details of the personalities, the ideologies polarization can be static or\ndynamic in time, even chaotic. Thus, agents with different personalities and\nlevels of memory (mnemomatter) can serve as a physics analogue of the ideology\ndynamics among ideological beings, illuminating how decisions influenced by\nindividual memories of past interactions can shape and influence subsequent\nideology polarization. Each constituent agent harbors a private stack memory\nand an onboard microcomputer/controller which both measures and controls its\nphysical spin handedness, which is a proxy for ideology. The agent's decision\nto change or retain its current spin is determined by each agent's private\nalgorithm for decisions (the personality) and the time-weighted stack history\nof present and previous interactions. Depending on a given agent's personality\nfor evaluating its memory and experiences, an agent can act as a curmudgeon who\nnever changes its ideology, a pushover who always accepts change, a contrarian\nwho always does the opposite of what is expected, an opportunist who weighs\nrecent events more heavily than past events in making decisions, and a\ntraditionalist who weighs past events more heavily than recent events in\ndecision making. We develop a field theory which maps agent ideological\npolarization over into a dynamic potential landscape. Perhaps such applications\nof physics-based systems to political systems will help us to understand the\nideological instability observed in the world today.",

To describe the long-time dynamics of such\nsystems, which is responsible for their most informative characteristics, we\ncan identify a few slow collective variables (CVs) while treating the remaining\nfast variables as thermal noise. This enables us to simplify the dynamics and\ntreat it as diffusion in a free-energy landscape spanned by slow CVs,\neffectively rendering the dynamics Markovian. Our recent statistical learning\ntechnique, spectral map [Rydzewski, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 22,\n5216-5220], explores this strategy to learn slow CVs by maximizing a spectral\ngap of a transition matrix. In this work, we introduce several advancements\ninto our framework, using a high-dimensional reversible folding process of a\nprotein as an example. We implement an algorithm for coarse-graining Markov\ntransition matrices to partition the reduced space of slow CVs kinetically and\nuse it to define a transition state ensemble. We show that slow CVs learned by\nspectral map closely approach the Markovian limit for an overdamped diffusion.\nWe demonstrate that coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficients only slightly\naffect the constructed free-energy landscapes. Finally, we present how spectral\nmap can be used to quantify the importance of features and compare slow CVs\nwith structural descriptors commonly used in protein folding. Overall, we\ndemonstrate that a single slow CV learned by spectral map can be used as a\nphysical reaction coordinate to capture essential characteristics of protein\nfolding.",

This approach facilitates very low-resolution face recognition by\njointly distilling generative and discriminative models via two distillation\nmodules. Firstly, the generative representation distillation takes the encoder\nof a diffusion model pretrained for face super-resolution as the generative\nteacher to supervise the learning of the student backbone via feature\nregression, and then freezes the student backbone. After that, the\ndiscriminative representation distillation further considers a pretrained face\nrecognizer as the discriminative teacher to supervise the learning of the\nstudent head via cross-resolution relational contrastive distillation. In this\nway, the general backbone representation can be transformed into discriminative\nhead representation, leading to a robust and discriminative student model for\nvery low-resolution face recognition.

The level of positiveness of each news\narticle is determined by FinBERT, a natural language processing model\nfine-tuned specifically for financial information. Supply chains of firms\nacross the world are identified mostly by financial statements, while those of\nJapanese firms are taken from large-scale firm-level surveys. We find that\npositive news increases the change rate of stock prices of firms mentioned in\nthe news before its disclosure, most likely because of diffusion of information\nthrough informal channels. Positive news also raises stock prices of the firms'\nsuppliers and customers before its disclosure, confirming propagation of market\nvalues through supply chains. In addition, we generally find a larger post-news\neffect on stock prices of the mentioned firms and their suppliers and customers\nthan the pre-news effect. The positive difference between the post- and\npre-news effects can be considered as the net effect of the disclosure of\npositive news, controlling for informal information diffusion. However, the\npost-news effect on suppliers and customers in Japan is smaller than the\npre-news effect, a result opposite to those from firms across the world.
