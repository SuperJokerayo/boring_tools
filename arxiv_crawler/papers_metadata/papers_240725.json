For bosonic encodings, we show how to obtain the GKP and\ncat qudit encodings by considering the appropriate groups, and essentially the\nsimplest physical implementations. We further illustrate this approach by\nintroducing a 2-mode bosonic code defined from a constellation of 48 coherent\nstates, for which all single-qubit Clifford gates correspond to passive\nGaussian unitaries.",

            "summary": "There has been considerable interest and resulting progress in implementing\nmachine learning (ML) models in hardware over the last several years from the\nparticle and nuclear physics communities. A big driver has been the release of\nthe Python package, hls4ml, which has enabled porting models specified and\ntrained using Python ML libraries to register transfer level (RTL) code. So\nfar, the primary end targets have been commercial FPGAs or synthesized custom\nblocks on ASICs. However, recent developments in open-source embedded FPGA\n(eFPGA) frameworks now provide an alternate, more flexible pathway for\nimplementing ML models in hardware. These customized eFPGA fabrics can be\nintegrated as part of an overall chip design. In general, the decision between\na fully custom, eFPGA, or commercial FPGA ML implementation will depend on the\ndetails of the end-use application. In this work, we explored the parameter\nspace for eFPGA implementations of fully-connected neural network (fcNN) and\nboosted decision tree (BDT) models using the task of neutron/gamma\nclassification with a specific focus on resource efficiency. We used data\ncollected using an AmBe sealed source incident on Stilbene, which was optically\ncoupled to an OnSemi J-series SiPM to generate training and test data for this\nstudy. We investigated relevant input features and the effects of\nbit-resolution and sampling rate as well as trade-offs in hyperparameters for\nboth ML architectures while tracking total resource usage. The performance\nmetric used to track model performance was the calculated neutron efficiency at\na gamma leakage of 10$^{-3}$. The results of the study will be used to aid the\nspecification of an eFPGA fabric, which will be integrated as part of a test\nchip.",

We model knowledge dissemination as a contagion process in which\nscientists become informed based on the propagation of knowledge through their\ncollaborators. We quantify the fairness of the system in terms of how women\nacquire and diffuse knowledge compared to men. Our results indicate that\nknowledge acquisition and diffusion are slower for women than expected. We find\nthat the main determinant of women's disadvantage is the gap in the cumulative\nnumber of collaborators, highlighting how time creates structural disadvantages\nthat contribute to marginalize women in physics.

After reviewing several classes of spherical quadrature methods in\nterms of their efficiency and error distribution, we derive guidelines for\nchoosing the best quadrature method for orientation averages and illustrate\nthese with three examples from chiral molecule physics.

Here, we update our previous model of the limits of\ngalvanotaxis due to stochasticity of sensor movements to account for cell shape\nand orientation. Computing the Fisher information, we find that cells in\nprinciple possess more information about the electric field direction when\ntheir long axis is parallel to the field, but that for weak fields\nmaximum-likelihood estimators of the field direction may actually have lower\nvariability when the cell's long axis is perpendicular to the field. In an\nalternate possibility, we find that if cells instead estimate the field\ndirection by taking the average of all the sensor locations as its directional\ncue (\"vector sum\"), this introduces a bias towards the short axis, an effect\nnot present for isotropic cells. We also explore the possibility that cell\nelongation arises downstream of sensor redistribution. We argue that if sensors\nmigrate to the cell's rear, the cell will expand perpendicular the field - as\nis more commonly observed - but if sensors migrate to the front, the cell will\nelongate parallel to the field.",

By further characterizing the functions that govern non-commutativity in\nthe configuration space using the algebra of angular momentum, we determine a\ngeneral form for the rotation generator in these theories and crucially, we\nshow that, under these conditions, unlike what has been previously found in the\nliterature at the quantum level, this requirement does not lead to the\nsuperselection of GUP models at the classical level.
