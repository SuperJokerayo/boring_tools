Using this concept, we examine the structure of the space\ncomprising all two-state vectors. We conclude that some pairs of two-state\nvectors or their statistical mixtures cannot be physically distinguished. In\nparticular, we demonstrate that not every non-separable two-state vector is\ndistinguishable from a statistical mixture of separable two-state vectors.

Firstly, the method exploits the\nZeno effect by conducting frequent projections to suppress gauge drift. These\nprojections utilize local gauge transformations to destructively interfere\nunphysical amplitudes via coupling to an ancillary qubit while the physical\namplitudes are left untouched, up to a less than unity normalization factor.\nSecondly, gauge transformations are conducted throughout the time evolution of\nthe system to hamper the speed of gauge drift.

We base our work on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a scene\nrepresentation composed of a mixture of Gaussians. Predicting such mixtures for\na human from a single input image is challenging, as it is a non-uniform\ndensity (with a many-to-one relationship with input pixels) with strict\nphysical constraints. At the same time, it needs to be flexible to accommodate\na variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of\nstandardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate density and\napproximate initial position for Gaussians. We can then train a transformer\nmodel to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as\nwell as the other Gaussians' attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show\nempirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can\nachieve fast inference of 3D human models from a single image without test-time\noptimization, expensive diffusion models, or 3D points supervision. We also\nshow that it can improve 3D pose estimation by better fitting human models that\naccount for clothes and other variations.

However, collecting the training data necessary to create\ngeneric and high-precision models is extremely challenging due to the\ndifficulty of annotation and the diversity of domains. Furthermore, it is\ndifficult to transfer training data across different crops, and although\nmachine learning models effective for specific environments, conditions, or\ncrops have been developed, they cannot be widely applied in actual fields. In\nthis study, we propose a generative data augmentation method (D4) for vineyard\nshoot detection. D4 uses a pre-trained text-guided diffusion model based on a\nlarge number of original images culled from video data collected by unmanned\nground vehicles or other means, and a small number of annotated datasets. The\nproposed method generates new annotated images with background information\nadapted to the target domain while retaining annotation information necessary\nfor object detection. In addition, D4 overcomes the lack of training data in\nagriculture, including the difficulty of annotation and diversity of domains.\nWe confirmed that this generative data augmentation method improved the mean\naverage precision by up to 28.65% for the BBox detection task and the average\nprecision by up to 13.73% for the keypoint detection task for vineyard shoot\ndetection. Our generative data augmentation method D4 is expected to\nsimultaneously solve the cost and domain diversity issues of training data\ngeneration in agriculture and improve the generalization performance of\ndetection models.",
