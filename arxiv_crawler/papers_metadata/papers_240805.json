One such scenario is\nquantum decoherence in neutrino oscillation which tends to destroy the\ninterference pattern of neutrinos reaching the far detector from the source. In\nthis work, we study the decoherence in neutrino oscillation in the context of\nthe ESSnuSB experiment. We consider the energy-independent decoherence\nparameter and derive the analytical expressions for P$_{\\mu e}$ and P$_{\\mu\n\\mu}$ probabilities in vacuum. We have computed the capability of ESSnuSB to\nput bounds on the decoherence parameters namely, $\\Gamma_{21}$ and\n$\\Gamma_{32}$ and found that the constraints on $\\Gamma_{21}$ are competitive\ncompared to the DUNE bounds and better than the most stringent LBL ones from\nMINOS/MINOS+. We have also investigated the impact of decoherence on the\nESSnuSB measurement of the Dirac CP phase $\\delta_{\\rm CP}$ and concluded that\nit remains robust in the presence of new physics.",

In this work, we aim to increase the diversity of generated images of\ncommon objects such that per-region variations are representative of the real\nworld. We introduce an inference time intervention, contextualized Vendi Score\nGuidance (c-VSG), that guides the backwards steps of latent diffusion models to\nincrease the diversity of a sample as compared to a \"memory bank\" of previously\ngenerated images while constraining the amount of variation within that of an\nexemplar set of real-world contextualizing images. We evaluate c-VSG with two\ngeographically representative datasets and find that it substantially increases\nthe diversity of generated images, both for the worst performing regions and on\naverage, while simultaneously maintaining or improving image quality and\nconsistency. Additionally, qualitative analyses reveal that diversity of\ngenerated images is significantly improved, including along the lines of\nreductive region portrayals present in the original model.

Mesh editing methods are typically framed as\noptimization problems combining user-specified vertex constraints with a\nregularizer that determines the position of the rest of the vertices. The\nchoice of the regularizer is key to the realism and authenticity of the final\nresult. Physics and geometry-based regularizers are not aware of the global\ncontext and semantics of the object, and the more recent deep learning priors\nare limited to a specific class of 3D object deformations. Our main\ncontribution is a vertex-based mesh editing method called DragD3D based on (1)\na novel optimization formulation that decouples the rotation and stretch\ncomponents of the deformation and combines a 3D geometric regularizer with (2)\nthe recently introduced DDS loss which scores the faithfulness of the rendered\n2D image to one from a diffusion model. Thus, our deformation method achieves\nglobally realistic shape deformation which is not restricted to any class of\nobjects. Our new formulation optimizes directly the transformation of the\nneural Jacobian field explicitly separating the rotational and stretching\ncomponents. The objective function of the optimization combines the approximate\ngradients of DDS and the gradients from the geometric loss to satisfy the\nvertex constraints. Additional user control over desired global shape\ndeformation is made possible by allowing explicit per-triangle deformation\ncontrol as well as explicit separation of rotational and stretching components\nof the deformation. We show that our deformations can be controlled to yield\nrealistic shape deformations that are aware of the global context of the\nobjects, and provide better results than just using geometric regularizers.",
