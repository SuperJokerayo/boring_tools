            "summary": "Contextuality is a key distinguishing feature between classical and quantum\nphysics. It expresses a fundamental obstruction to describing quantum theory\nusing classical concepts. In turn, understood as a resource for quantum\ncomputation, it is expected to hold the key to quantum advantage. Yet, despite\nits long recognised importance in quantum foundations and, more recently, in\nquantum computation, the structural essence of contextuality has remained\nsomewhat elusive - different frameworks address different aspects of the\nphenomenon, yet their precise relationship often remains unclear. This issue\nalready looms large at the level of the Bell-Kochen-Specker theorem: while\ntraditional proofs proceed by showing the nonexistence of valuations, the\nnotion of state-independent contextuality in the marginal approach allows to\nprove contextuality from seemingly weaker assumptions. In the light of this,\nand at the absence of a unified mathematical framework for Kochen-Specker\ncontextuality, the original algebraic approach has been widely abandoned, in\nfavour of the study of contextual correlations.\n  Here, we reinstate the algebraic perspective on contextuality. Concretely, by\nbuilding on the novel concept of context connections, we reformulate the\nalgebraic relations between observables originally postulated by Kochen and\nSpecker, and we explicitly demonstrate their consistency with the notion of\nstate-independent contextuality. In the present paper, we focus on the new\nconceptual ideas and discuss them in the concrete setting of spin-1\nobservables, specifically those in the example of [S. Yu and C.H. Oh, Phys.\nRev. Lett., 108, 030402 (2012)]; in a companion paper, we generalise these\nideas, obtain a complete characterisation of Kochen-Specker contextuality and\nprovide a detailed comparison with the related notions of contextuality in the\nmarginal and graph-theoretic approach.",

            "summary": "We propose a framework to perform Bayesian inference using conditional\nscore-based diffusion models to solve a class of inverse problems in mechanics\ninvolving the inference of a specimen's spatially varying material properties\nfrom noisy measurements of its mechanical response to loading. Conditional\nscore-based diffusion models are generative models that learn to approximate\nthe score function of a conditional distribution using samples from the joint\ndistribution. More specifically, the score functions corresponding to multiple\nrealizations of the measurement are approximated using a single neural network,\nthe so-called score network, which is subsequently used to sample the posterior\ndistribution using an appropriate Markov chain Monte Carlo scheme based on\nLangevin dynamics. Training the score network only requires simulating the\nforward model. Hence, the proposed approach can accommodate black-box forward\nmodels and complex measurement noise. Moreover, once the score network has been\ntrained, it can be re-used to solve the inverse problem for different\nrealizations of the measurements. We demonstrate the efficacy of the proposed\napproach on a suite of high-dimensional inverse problems in mechanics that\ninvolve inferring heterogeneous material properties from noisy measurements.\nSome examples we consider involve synthetic data, while others include data\ncollected from actual elastography experiments. Further, our applications\ndemonstrate that the proposed approach can handle different measurement\nmodalities, complex patterns in the inferred quantities, non-Gaussian and\nnon-additive noise models, and nonlinear black-box forward models. The results\nshow that the proposed framework can solve large-scale physics-based inverse\nproblems efficiently.",

            "summary": "The two-layer quasi-geostrophic equations (2QGE) is a simplified model that\ndescribes the dynamics of a stratified, wind-driven ocean in terms of potential\nvorticity and stream function. Its numerical simulation is plagued by a high\ncomputational cost due to the size of the typical computational domain and the\nneed for high resolution to capture the full spectrum of turbulent scales. In\nthis paper, we present a data-driven reduced order model (ROM) for the 2QGE\nthat drastically reduces the computational time to predict ocean dynamics,\nespecially when there are variable physical parameters. The main building\nblocks of our ROM are: i) proper orthogonal decomposition (POD) and ii) long\nshort-term memory (LSTM) recurrent neural networks. Snapshots data are\ncollected from a high-resolution simulation for part of the time interval of\ninterest and for given parameter values in the case of variable parameters. POD\nis applied to each field variable to extract the dominant modes and a LSTM\nmodel is trained on the modal coefficients associated with the snapshots for\neach variable. Then, the trained LSTM models predict the modal coefficients for\nthe remaining part of the time interval of interest and for a new parameter\nvalue. To illustrate the predictive performance of our POD-LSTM ROM and the\ncorresponding time savings, we consider an extension of the so-called\ndouble-gyre wind forcing test. We show that the POD-LSTM ROM is accurate in\npredicting both time-averaged fields and time-dependent quantities (modal\ncoefficients, enstrophy, and kinetic energy), even when retaining only 10-20\\%\nof the singular value energy of the system. The computational speed up for the\nprediction is about up to 1E+07 compared to a finite volume based full order\nmethod.",

We first construct physical\nvertex operators that correspond to long strings. Due to the GSO projection,\nthey depend on the parity of the spectral flow parameter $w$. For a given $w$,\nwe construct the physical operators that have the lowest space-time weights in\nboth the NS and R sector. Then, we calculate three point correlators for each\npossible type of parities of spectral flows. We find that the recursion\nrelations of correlators in the bosonic SL$(2,\\mathbb{R})$ WZW model can be\nunderstood from the equivalence of these superstring correlators with different\npicture choices. Furthermore, after carefully mapping the vertex operators to\nappropriate operators in the dual CFT, we find that once the fermionic\ncontributions together with the picture changing effects are correctly taken\ninto account, some mathematical identities of covering maps lead to the\nmatching of the correlators of the two sides. We check this explicitly at the\nleading order in the conformal perturbation computation and conjecture that\nthis remains correct to all orders.",

Biotite stands out as a\nnon-degradable LM under ambient conditions, featuring high-quality basal\ncleavage, a significant advantage for van der Waals heterostructure (vdWH)\napplications. In this work, we present the micro-mechanical exfoliation of\nbiotite down to monolayers (1Ls), yielding ultrathin flakes with large areas\nand atomically flat surfaces. To identify and characterize the mineral, we\nconducted a multi-elemental analysis of biotite using energy-dispersive\nspectroscopy mapping. Additionally, synchrotron infrared nano-spectroscopy was\nemployed to probe its vibrational signature in few-layer form, with sensitivity\nto the layer number. We have also observed good morphological and structural\nstability in time (up to 12 months) and no important changes in their physical\nproperties after thermal annealing processes in ultrathin biotite flakes.\nConductive atomic force microscopy evaluated its electrical capacity, revealing\nan electrical breakdown strength of approximately 1 V/nm. Finally, we explore\nthe use of biotite as a substrate and encapsulating LM in vdWH applications. We\nhave performed optical and magneto-optical measurements at low temperatures. We\nfind that ultrathin biotite flakes work as a good substrate for 1L-MoSe2,\ncomparable to hexagonal boron nitride flakes, but it induces a small change of\nthe 1L-MoSe2 g-factor values, most likely due to natural impurities on its\ncrystal structure. Furthermore, our results show that biotite flakes are useful\nsystems to protect sensitive LMs such as black phosphorus from degradation for\nup to 60 days in ambient air. Our study introduces biotite as a promising,\ncost-effective LM for the advancement of future ultrathin nanotechnologies.",

Despite great success in dense-view reconstruction scenarios,\nrendering a detailed scene from insufficient captured views is still an\nill-posed optimization problem, often resulting in artifacts and distortions in\nunseen areas. In this paper, we propose ReconX, a novel 3D scene reconstruction\nparadigm that reframes the ambiguous reconstruction challenge as a temporal\ngeneration task. The key insight is to unleash the strong generative prior of\nlarge pre-trained video diffusion models for sparse-view reconstruction.\nHowever, 3D view consistency struggles to be accurately preserved in directly\ngenerated video frames from pre-trained models. To address this, given limited\ninput views, the proposed ReconX first constructs a global point cloud and\nencodes it into a contextual space as the 3D structure condition. Guided by the\ncondition, the video diffusion model then synthesizes video frames that are\nboth detail-preserved and exhibit a high degree of 3D consistency, ensuring the\ncoherence of the scene from various perspectives. Finally, we recover the 3D\nscene from the generated video through a confidence-aware 3D Gaussian Splatting\noptimization scheme.
