            "summary": "Physicists routinely need probabilistic models for a number of tasks such as\nparameter inference or the generation of new realizations of a field.\nEstablishing such models for highly non-Gaussian fields is a challenge,\nespecially when the number of samples is limited. In this paper, we introduce\nscattering spectra models for stationary fields and we show that they provide\naccurate and robust statistical descriptions of a wide range of fields\nencountered in physics. These models are based on covariances of scattering\ncoefficients, i.e. wavelet decomposition of a field coupled with a point-wise\nmodulus. After introducing useful dimension reductions taking advantage of the\nregularity of a field under rotation and scaling, we validate these models on\nvarious multi-scale physical fields and demonstrate that they reproduce\nstandard statistics, including spatial moments up to 4th order. These\nscattering spectra provide us with a low-dimensional structured representation\nthat captures key properties encountered in a wide range of physical fields.\nThese generic models can be used for data exploration, classification,\nparameter inference, symmetry detection, and component separation.",

There are two distinguishing aspects of our approach. The\nfirst aspect is its dyadically localised nature: The nontrivial part of the\nanalysis is reduced entirely to time-translation invariant $r^p$-weighted\nestimates, in the spirit of [DR09], to be applied on dyadic time-slabs which\nfor large $r$ are outgoing. Global existence and decay then both immediately\nfollow by elementary iteration on consecutive such time-slabs, without further\nglobal bootstrap. The second, and more fundamental, aspect is our direct use of\na \"blackbox\" linear inhomogeneous energy estimate on exactly stationary\nmetrics, together with a novel but elementary physical space top order identity\nthat need not capture the structure of trapping and is robust to perturbation.\nIn the specific example of Kerr black holes, the required linear inhomogeneous\nestimate can then be quoted directly from the literature [DRSR16], while the\nadditional top order physical space identity can be shown easily in many cases\n(we include in the Appendix a proof for the Kerr case $\\vert a \\vert \\ll M$,\nwhich can in fact be understood in this context simply as a perturbation of\nSchwarzschild). In particular, the approach circumvents the need either for\nproducing a purely physical space identity capturing trapping or for a careful\nanalysis of the commutation properties of frequency projections with the wave\noperator of time-dependent metrics.",

The method extends our\nprevious [DHRT22], which considered such equations on a wide class of\nbackground spacetimes, including Kerr, but restricted in that case to the very\nslowly rotating regime $|a|\\ll M$ (which may be treated simply as a\nperturbation of Schwarzschild $a=0$). To handle the general $|a|<M$ case, our\npresent proof is based on two ingredients: (i) the linear inhomogeneous\nestimates on Kerr backgrounds proven in [DRSR16], further refined however in\norder to gain a derivative in elliptic frequency regimes, and (ii) the\nexistence of appropriate physical space currents satisfying degenerate\ncoercivity properties, but which now must be tailored to a finite number of\nwave packets defined by suitable frequency projection. The above ingredients\ncan be thought of as adaptations of the two basic ingredients of [DHRT22],\nexploiting however the peculiarities of the Kerr geometry. The novel frequency\ndecomposition in (ii), inspired by the boundedness arguments of [DR11, DRSR16],\nis defined using only azimuthal and stationary frequencies, and serves both to\nseparate the superradiant and non-superradiant parts of the solution and to\nlocalise trapping to small regions of spacetime. The strengthened (i), on the\nother hand, allows us to relax the required coercivity properties of our\nwave-packet dependent currents, so as in particular to accept top order errors\nprovided that they are localised to the elliptic frequency regime. These error\nterms are analysed with the help of the full Carter separation.",

            "summary": "A novel cold neutron source (CNS) employing chessboard or staircase\nassemblies of high-aspect ratio rectangular (HARR) para-hydrogen (p-H2)\nmoderators is proposed. It is demonstrated that this design can generate\nneutron beams with higher intensity and brightness, up to 2.5 times more than\nany p-H2 based CNS with an equal cold neutron beam cross-section made of a\nsingle moderator (flat or voluminous). Two limiting factors for this gain are\nidentified: the limited volume of the high-density thermal neutron region\nsurrounding the reactor core or spallation target imposing constraints on the\ntotal length of the moderator assembly and the finite width of moderator walls.\nAdditional factors affecting gain can be revealed by dedicated Monte Carlo\nsimulations of the moderator-reflector assembly, which can only be conducted\nfor a particular neutron source and are beyond the scope of this general study.\nMoreover, the relatively large length of moderator assemblies makes their\napplication for short pulse neutron sources very problematic. Analytic approach\nfor calculating the brightness of p-H2 moderators is introduced. Because\nbrightness gain originates from a near-the-surface effect resulting from the\nprevailing single collision process, HARR CMs offer a significant increase, up\nto a factor of 10, in cold neutron brightness. The obtained results are in\nexcellent agreement with MCNP calculations. The concept of 'low-dimensionality'\n(low-d) in moderators is explored: achieving a substantial increase in\nbrightness necessitates CMs to be low-d both geometrically (HARR) and\nphysically, requiring the moderator's smallest dimension to be smaller than the\nmean free path for thermal neutrons. This explains why additional compression\nof the CM along the longest direction, effectively giving it a tube-like shape,\ndoes not leads to a significant brightness increase comparable to the\nflattening of CM.",

By leveraging a multimodal and\ntransformation-invariant contrastive learning framework, LInK learns a joint\nrepresentation that captures complex physics and design representations of\nmechanisms, enabling rapid retrieval from a vast dataset of over 10 million\nmechanisms. This approach improves precision through the warm start of a\nhierarchical unconstrained nonlinear optimization algorithm, combining the\nrobustness of traditional optimization with the speed and adaptability of\nmodern deep learning methods. Our results on an existing benchmark demonstrate\nthat LInK outperforms existing methods with 28 times less error compared to a\nstate of the art approach while taking 20 times less time on an existing\nbenchmark.

To\nbridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework\ntailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a\nphysics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time\nseries into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand\nsophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy.\nMoreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which\nintroduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project\nspatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the\ninformation loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived\nby PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed\nRePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in\ndata-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior\ngeneralization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.",

It determines the associated\ninfinitely many Noether charges stemming from a gauge fixed and BRST invariant\nLagrangian, a result that cannot be obtained from Noether's second theorem. The\ngeometrical significance of this result is highlighted by the construction of a\ntrigraded BRST covariant phase space, allowing a BRST invariant gauge fixing\nprocedure. This provides an appropriate framework for determining the conserved\nBRST Noether current of the global BRST symmetry and the associated global\nNoether charges. The latter are found to be equivalent with the usual classical\ncorner charges of large gauge transformations. It allows one to prove the gauge\nindependence of their physical effects at the perturbative quantum level. In\nparticular, the underlying BRST fundamental canonical relation provides the\nsame graded symplectic brackets as in the classical covariant phase space. A\nunified Lagrangian Ward identity for small and large gauge transformations is\nbuilt. It consistently decouples into a bulk part for small gauge\ntransformations, which is the standard BRST--BV quantum master equation, and a\nboundary part for large gauge transformations. The boundary part provides a\nperturbation theory origin for the invariance of the Hamiltonian physical\n$\\mathcal{S}$-matrix under asymptotic symmetries. Holographic anomalies for the\nboundary Ward identity are studied and found to be solutions of a codimension\none Wess--Zumino consistency condition.

We decompose the molecule\ngeneration process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric\nrepresentation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the\nrepresentation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively\neasy-to-generate representation in the first-stage guides the second-stage\ngeneration to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much\nfaster way. Leveraging EDM as the base generator, we observe significant\nquality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely-used\nQM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets.
