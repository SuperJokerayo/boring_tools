We propose an extension of Hermite\nDistributed Approximating Functionals (HDAF) to MPS, a highly accurate\npseudospectral method for approximating functions of derivatives. Integrating\nHDAF into an MPS finite precision algebra, we test four types of\nquantum-inspired algorithms for time evolution: explicit Runge-Kutta methods,\nCrank-Nicolson method, explicitly restarted Arnoli iteration and split-step.\nThe benchmark problem is the expansion of a particle in a quantum quench,\ncharacterized by a rapid increase in space requirements, where HDAF surpasses\ntraditional finite difference methods in accuracy with a comparable cost.\nMoreover, the efficient HDAF approximation to the free propagator avoids the\nneed for Fourier transforms in split-step methods, significantly enhancing\ntheir performance with an improved balance in cost and accuracy. Both\napproaches exhibit similar error scaling and run times compared to FFT vector\nmethods; however, MPS offer an exponential advantage in memory, overcoming\nvector limitations to enable larger discretizations and expansions. Finally,\nthe MPS HDAF split-step method successfully reproduces the physical behavior of\na particle expansion in a double-well potential, demonstrating viability for\nactual research scenarios.",

We propose a\ncomplete physical picture of the monopole-fermion interaction which encompasses\nall angular momentum modes. We show that as an in-going fermion scatters off a\nmonopole, it excites trapped $W$-bosons in the monopole core by a version of\nthe Witten effect so that the monopole can accrue charge and transform into a\ndyon at parametrically low energies. The imparted electric charge is then\nprotected from decay by an emergent $\\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalized global symmetry,\ncreating a stable dyon. At sufficiently low energies, the scattered fermion can\nbe trapped by the dyon's electrostatic potential, forming a bound state, which\ncan decay into spherically symmetric fermion modes subject to the preserved\n$\\mathbb{Z}_N$ global symmetry. We propose that monopole-fermion scattering can\nbe described in this way without needing to add ``new'' states to the Hilbert\nspace, thereby eliminating a long standing confusion in the Callan Rubakov\neffect.",

PIML is characterized by the incorporation of\nphysical laws into the training process of machine learning models in lieu of\nlarge data when solving PDE problems. Despite the overall success of this\ncollection of methods, it remains incredibly difficult to analyze, benchmark,\nand generally compare one approach to another. Using Kolmogorov n-widths as a\nmeasure of effectiveness of approximating functions, we judiciously apply this\nmetric in the comparison of various multitask PIML architectures. We compute\nlower accuracy bounds and analyze the model's learned basis functions on\nvarious PDE problems. This is the first objective metric for comparing\nmultitask PIML architectures and helps remove uncertainty in model validation\nfrom selective sampling and overfitting. We also identify avenues of\nimprovement for model architectures, such as the choice of activation function,\nwhich can drastically affect model generalization to \"worst-case\" scenarios,\nwhich is not observed when reporting task-specific errors.

We then consider inverse\nbeta decay in which an electron is emitted following the capture of a neutrino\non a nucleus. While both the incident neutrino and final electron spins are\nantiparallel to their momenta, the final spin is in a different direction than\nthat of the neutrino -- an apparent change of angular momentum. However, prior\nto measurement of the final particle, in all these cases angular momentum is\nindeed conserved, The apparent non-conservation of angular momentum arises in\nthe quantum measurement process in which the measuring apparatus does not have\nan initially well-defined angular momentum, but is localized in the outside\nworld.

We investigate the conditions under which JDE can\nmanifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a\nspin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between\ntwo superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and\na Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the\nsuperconductors are purely singlet, the introduction of triplet pairing in the\nsuperconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the\npotential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further\ndemonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when\nthe directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear,\nprovided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing.\nAdditionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent,\nnamely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and\nthe triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always\naccompanied by the anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is\nfound to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum\nwire, driven by Fabry-P\\'erot interference effects.

The recent effort in simplifying the masked\ndiffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion\nmodels and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper,\nhowever, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically\nfree from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models,\nand are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling\naspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we\nshow that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation\nprocess while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling\nand achieving a 20$\\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation challenges\nprevious claims that MDMs can surpass ARMs in generative perplexity. We\nidentify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the\n32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical\nsampling.

In this study, we propose \\textbf{PoseTalk}, a\nTHG system that can freely generate lip-synchronized talking head videos with\nfree head poses conditioned on text prompts and audio. The core insight of our\nmethod is using head pose to connect visual, linguistic, and audio signals.\nFirst, we propose to generate poses from both audio and text prompts, where the\naudio offers short-term variations and rhythm correspondence of the head\nmovements and the text prompts describe the long-term semantics of head\nmotions. To achieve this goal, we devise a Pose Latent Diffusion (PLD) model to\ngenerate motion latent from text prompts and audio cues in a pose latent space.\nSecond, we observe a loss-imbalance problem: the loss for the lip region\ncontributes less than 4\\% of the total reconstruction loss caused by both pose\nand lip, making optimization lean towards head movements rather than lip\nshapes. To address this issue, we propose a refinement-based learning strategy\nto synthesize natural talking videos using two cascaded networks, i.e.,\nCoarseNet, and RefineNet. The CoarseNet estimates coarse motions to produce\nanimated images in novel poses and the RefineNet focuses on learning finer lip\nmotions by progressively estimating lip motions from low-to-high resolutions,\nyielding improved lip-synchronization performance.

To address\nthis issue, here we introduce an innovative video inverse solver that leverages\nonly image diffusion models.

Our approach synergistically combines batch-consistent sampling with\nsimultaneous optimization of denoised spatio-temporal batches at each reverse\ndiffusion step, resulting in a novel and efficient diffusion sampling strategy\nfor video inverse problems.
