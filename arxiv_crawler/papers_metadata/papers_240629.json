Our work is inspired by recent discussions of \"topologically\nrobust Hilbert space fragmentation,\" but massively generalizes in two\ndirections: firstly from states describable as \"loop-soups\" to a broader class\nof states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models\nrestricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices\n(and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions\nleverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)],\nand identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of \"group-model\ndynamics\" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories,\nand our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.",

            "summary": "Depending on the coupling to the environment, symmetries of open quantum\nsystems manifest in two distinct forms, the strong and the weak. We study the\nspontaneous symmetry breaking among phases with different symmetries. Concrete\nLiouvillian models with strong and weak symmetry are constructed, and different\nscenarios of symmetry-breaking transitions are investigated from complementary\napproaches. It is demonstrated that strong symmetry always spontaneously breaks\ninto the corresponding weak symmetry. For strong $U(1)$ symmetry, we show that\nstrong-to-weak symmetry breaking leads to gapless Goldstone modes dictating\ndiffusion of the symmetry charge in translational invariant systems. We\nconjecture that this relation among strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, gapless\nmodes, and symmetry-charge diffusion is general for continuous symmetries. It\ncan be interpreted as an \"enhanced Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem\" for open\nquantum systems, according to which the gapless spectrum does not require\nnon-integer filling. We also investigate the scenario where the strong symmetry\nbreaks completely. In the symmetry-broken phase, we identify an effective\nKeldysh action with two Goldstone modes, describing fluctuations of the order\nparameter and diffusive hydrodynamics of the symmetry charge, respectively. For\na particular model studied here, we uncover a transition from a symmetric phase\nwith a \"Bose surface\" to a symmetry-broken phase with long-range order induced\nby tuning the filling. It is also shown that the long-range order of $U(1)$\nsymmetry breaking is possible in spatial dimension $d\\geq 3$, in both weak and\nstrong symmetry cases. Our work outline the typical scenarios of spontaneous\nsymmetry breaking in open quantum systems, and highlights their physical\nconsequences.",

My study is motivated\nby a simple argument that the constraints on inflationary parameters, most\ntypically the spectral index $n_s$, depend to some extent on the cosmological\nframework. To avoid broadening the uncertainties resulting from marginalizing\nover additional parameters (typical in many alternative models), I first adopt\nthe same alternative viewpoint of previous studies and analyze what happens if\na physical theory can fix extra parameters to non-standard values. Focusing on\nthe dark energy equation of state $w$ and the effective number of relativistic\nspecies $N_{\\rm{eff}}$, I confirm that physical theories able to fix $w \\approx\n-1.2$ or $N_{\\rm{eff}} \\approx 3.9$ produce values of $H_0$ from CMB and BAO in\nline with the local distance ladder estimate. While in the former case I do not\nfind any relevant implications for inflation, in the latter scenarios, I\nobserve a shift towards $n_s \\approx 1$. From a model-selection perspective,\nboth cases are strongly disfavored compared to $\\Lambda$CDM. However, models\nwith $N_{\\rm{eff}} \\approx 3.3 - 3.4$ could bring the $H_0$ tension down to\n$\\sim 3\\sigma$ while being moderately disfavored. Yet, this is enough to change\nthe constraints on inflation so that the most accredited models (e.g.,\nStarobinsky inflation) would no longer be favored by data. I then focus on\nEarly Dark Energy (EDE), arguing that an EDE fraction $f_{\\rm{EDE}}\\sim 0.04 -\n0.06$ (only able to mildly reduce the $H_0$-tension down to $\\sim 3\\sigma$)\ncould already require a similar change in perspective on inflation. In fact,\nperforming a full joint analysis of EDE and Starobinsky inflation, I find that\nthe two models can hardly coexist for $f_{\\rm{EDE}}\\gtrsim 0.06$.",

We consider two proposals, both via\npatch-deformation: one that applies a transversal Hadamard gate (i.e. a domain\nwall through time) to interchange the logical $X$ and $Z$ strings, and another\nthat applies a domain wall through space to achieve this interchange. We\nexplain in detail why they perform the logical Hadamard gate by tracking how\nthe stabilisers and the logical operators are transformed in each quantum\nerror-correction round. We optimise the physical circuits and evaluate their\nlogical failure probabilities, which we find to be comparable to those of a\nquantum memory experiment for the same number of quantum error-correction\nrounds. We present syndrome-extraction circuits that maintain the same\neffective distance under circuit-level noise as under phenomenological noise.\nWe also explain how a $SWAP$-quantum error-correction round (required to return\nthe patch to its initial position) can be compiled to only four two-qubit gate\nlayers.

            "summary": "Ionic crystals play a central role in functional applications. Mesoscale\ndescriptions of these crystals are based on the continuum polarization density\nfield to represent the effective physics of charge distribution at the scale of\nthe atomic lattice. However, a long-standing difficulty is that the classical\nelectrostatic definition of the macroscopic polarization -- as the dipole or\nfirst moment of the charge density in a unit cell -- is not unique. This\nunphysical non-uniqueness has been shown to arise from starting directly with\nan infinite system rather than starting with a finite body and taking\nappropriate limits. This limit process shows that the electrostatic description\nrequires not only the bulk polarization density, but also the surface charge\ndensity, as the effective macroscopic descriptors; that is, a nonlocal\neffective description. Other approaches to resolve this difficulty include\nrelating the change in polarization to the transport of charge; or, to define\nthe polarization as the energy-conjugate to the electric field.\n  This work examines the relation between the classical electrostatic\ndefinition of polarization, and the transport and energy-conjugate definitions\nof polarization. We show the following: (1) The transport of charge does not\ncorrespond to the change in polarization in general; instead, one requires\nadditional simplifying assumptions on the electrostatic definition of\npolarization for these approaches to give rise to the same macroscopic electric\nfields. Thus, the electrostatic definition encompasses the transport definition\nas a special case. (2) The energy-conjugate definition has both bulk and\nsurface contributions; while traditional approaches neglect the surface\ncontribution, we find that accounting for the nonlocal surface contributions is\nessential to obtain the correct macroscopic electric fields.",
