            "summary": "The expected improvements in the precision of inflationary physics\nobservables including the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the\ntensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ will reveal more than just the viability of a\nparticular model of inflation. In the presence of a curvaton field $\\chi$,\nsupposedly dead models of inflation can be resurrected as these observables are\naffected by curvaton perturbations. For currently successful models, improved\nconstraints will enable us to constrain the properties of extra decaying scalar\ndegrees of freedom produced during inflation. In this work, we demonstrate\nthese diverse uses of a curvaton field with the most recent constraints on\n($n_{s},r$) and two exemplary inflation models, the Starobinsky model, and a\nmodel of new inflation. Our analysis invokes three free parameters: the\ncurvaton mass $m_{\\chi}$, its decay rate $\\Gamma_{\\chi}$ the reheating\ntemperature $T_{\\rm RH}$ produced by inflaton decays. We systematically analyze\npossible post-inflationary era scenarios of a curvaton field. By projecting the\nmost recent CMB data on ($n_{s},r$) into this parameter space, we can either\nset constraints on the curvaton parameters from successful models of inflation\n(so that the success is not spoiled) or determine the parameters which are able\nto save a model for which $n_{s}$ is predicted to be below the experimental\ndata. We emphasize that the initial value of $\\langle \\chi^2 \\rangle \\propto\nH^4/m_\\chi^2$ produced during inflation is determined from a stochastic\napproach and thus not a free parameter in our analysis. We also investigate the\nproduction of local non-Gaussianity $f_{NL}^{(\\rm loc)}$ and apply current CMB\nconstraints to the parameter space. Intriguingly, we find that a large value of\n$f_{NL}^{(\\rm loc)}$ of $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ can be produced for both of the two\nrepresentative inflation models.",

            "summary": "The standard Komar charge is a $(d-2)$-form that can be defined in spacetimes\nadmitting a Killing vector and which is closed when the vacuum Einstein\nequations are satisfied. Its integral at spatial infinity (the Komar integral)\ngives the conserved charge associated to the Killing vector, and, due to its\non-shell closedness, the same value (expressed in terms of other physical\nvariables) is obtained integrating over the event horizon (if any). This\nequality is the basis of the Smarr formula. This charge can be generalized so\nthat it still is closed on-shell in presence of matter and its integrals give\ngeneralizations of the Smarr formula. We show how the Komar charge and other\nclosed $(d-2)$-form charges can be used to prove non-existence theorems for\ngravitational solitons and boson stars. In particular, we show how one can deal\nwith generalized symmetric fields (invariant under a combination of isometries\nand other global symmetries) and how the geralized symmetric ansatz permits to\nevade the non-existence theorems.",

This is particularly relevant for\neffort-sensitive, dynamics-dependent tasks such as tightening a valve. To\nperform these tasks safely and reliably, robots must be able to quickly adapt\nin response to unexpected changes during task execution. Humans can intuitively\nrespond and adapt their manipulation strategy to suit such problems, but\nrepresenting and implementing such behaviors for robots remains an open\nquestion. We present the adaptive behavior tree, which enables a robot to\nquickly adapt to both visual and non-visual observations during task execution,\npreempting task failure or switching to a different strategy based on data from\nprevious attempts. We test our approach on a number of tasks commonly found in\nindustrial settings. Our results demonstrate safety, robustness (100% success\nrate for all but one experiment) and efficiency in task completion (eg, an\noverall task speedup of 46% on average for valve tightening), and would reduce\ndependency on human supervision and intervention.",

In this work, in the\nReissner-Nordstr\\\"om case, I relate these ratios with the quantization of the\nhorizon area, or equivalently of the entropy. Furthermore, these ratios are\nrelated to a century-old work of Kasner, in which he conjectured that certain\nsequences arising from complex analysis may have a quantum interpretation.\nThese numbers also appear in the case of Kerr black holes, but the explanation\nis not as straightforward. The Kasner ratio may also be relevant for\nunderstanding the random matrix and random graph approaches to black hole\nphysics, such as fast scrambling of quantum information, via a bound related to\nRamanujan graph.

A key innovation is the integration of science and\nengineering practices through Engineering Design (ED)-based physics laboratory\ntasks, where students tackle engineering design problems by applying physics\nprinciples. While this approach has its benefits, research shows that students\ndo not always effectively apply scientific concepts, but instead rely on\ntrial-and-error approaches, and end up gadgeteering their way to a solution.\nThis leads to what is commonly referred to as the \"design-science gap\" -- that\nstudents do not always consciously apply science concepts while solving a\ndesign problem. However, as obvious as the notion of a `gap' may appear, there\nseems to exist no consensus on the definitions of `design' and `science',\nfurther complicating the understanding of this `gap'. This qualitative study\naddresses the notion of the design-science gap by examining student-groups'\ndiscussions and written lab reports from a multi-week ED-based undergraduate\nintroductory physics laboratory task. Building on our earlier studies, we\ndeveloped and employed a nuanced, multi-layered coding scheme inspired by the\nGioia Framework to characterize `design thinking' and `science thinking'. We\ndiscuss how student-groups engage in various aspects of design and how they\napply concepts physics principles to solve the problem. In the process, we\ndemonstrate the interconnectedness of students' design thinking and science\nthinking. We advocate for the usage of the term ``design--science connection''\nas opposed to ``design--science gap'' to deepen both design and scientific\nthinking.

The sPlot\nformalism is a common tool used to isolate distributions from different\nsources.

This article demonstrates how\ndensity ratio estimation can be applied to convert sWeights to event\nprobabilities, which we call drWeights. The drWeights can then be applied to\nproduce the distributions of interest and are consistent with direct use of the\nsWeights. This article will also show how decision trees are particular well\nsuited to converting sWeights, with the benefit of fast prediction rates and\nadaptability to aspects of the experimental data such as data sample size and\nproportions of different event sources.
