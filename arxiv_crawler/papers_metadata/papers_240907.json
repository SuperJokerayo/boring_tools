            "summary": "We develop a hybrid oscillator-qubit processor framework for quantum\nsimulation of strongly correlated fermions and bosons that avoids the\nboson-to-qubit mapping overhead encountered in qubit hardware. This framework\ngives exact decompositions of particle interactions such as density-density\nterms and gauge-invariant hopping, as well as approximate methods based on the\nBaker-Campbell Hausdorff formulas including the magnetic field term for the\n$U(1)$ quantum link model in $(2+1)$D. We use this framework to show how to\nsimulate dynamics using Trotterisation, perform ancilla-free partial error\ndetection using Gauss's law, measure non-local observables, estimate ground\nstate energies using a oscillator-qubit variational quantum eigensolver as well\nas quantum signal processing, and we numerically study the influence of\nhardware errors in circuit QED experiments. To show the advantages over\nall-qubit hardware, we perform an end-to-end comparison of the gate complexity\nfor the gauge-invariant hopping term and find an improvement of the asymptotic\nscaling with the boson number cutoff $S$ from $\\mathcal{O}(\\log(S)^2)$ to\n$\\mathcal{O}(1)$ in our framework as well as, for bosonic matter, a constant\nfactor improvement of better than $10^4$. We also find an improvement from\n$\\mathcal{O}(\\log(S))$ to $\\mathcal{O}(1)$ for the $U(1)$ magnetic field term.\nWhile our work focusses on an implementation in superconducting hardware, our\nframework can also be used in trapped ion, and neutral atom hardware. This work\nestablishes digital quantum simulation with hybrid oscillator-qubit hardware as\na viable and advantageous method for the study of qubit-boson models in\nmaterials science, chemistry, and high-energy physics.",

In this paper, we first introduce a general method\nfor designing the rectilinear cooling channel.

When many structurally-equivalent circuits need to be measured,\ngenerating sequences for each circuit is unnecessary and cumbersome, since\ncompiling and loading sequences onto classical control hardware is a primary\nbottleneck in quantum circuit execution. In this work, we develop a\nhardware-assisted protocol for executing parameterized circuits on our\nFPGA-based control hardware, QubiC. This protocol relies on a hardware-software\nco-design technique in which software identifies structural equivalency in\ncircuits and \"peels\" off the relevant parameterized angles to reduce the\noverall waveform compilation time. The hardware architecture then performs\nreal-time \"stitching\" of the parameters in the circuit to measure circuits that\nimplement a different overall logical operation.

            "summary": "When a pulse of light traverses a material, it incurs a time delay referred\nto as the group delay. Should the group delay experienced by photons be\nattributed to the time they spend as atomic excitations? However reasonable\nthis connection may seem, it appears problematic when the frequency of the\nlight is close to the atomic resonance, as the group delay becomes negative in\nthis regime. To address this question, we use the cross-Kerr effect to probe\nthe degree of atomic excitation caused by a resonant transmitted photon, by\nmeasuring the phase shift on a separate beam that is weak and off-resonant. Our\nresults, over a range of pulse durations and optical depths, are consistent\nwith the recent theoretical prediction that the mean atomic excitation time\ncaused by a transmitted photon (as measured via the time integral of the\nobserved phase shift) equals the group delay experienced by the light.\nSpecifically, we measure mean atomic excitation times ranging from $(-0.82\\pm\n0.31) \\tau_0$ for the most narrowband pulse to $(0.54\\pm 0.28) \\tau_0$ for the\nmost broadband pulse, where $\\tau_0$ is the non-post-selected excitation time,\ngiven by the scattering (absorption) probability multiplied by the atomic\nlifetime $\\tau_{\\rm sp}$. These results suggest that negative values taken by\ntimes such as the group delay have more physical significance than has\ngenerally been appreciated.",

For $N$ qubits without measurements, the\nsaturation value scales as $2^{N-1}$, and the saturation time scales as $2^N$.\nThis behaviour remains identical in the presence of random measurements with\ndifferent probabilities, indicating that this notion of complexity is\ninsensitive to the rate of measurement.

Within our benchmarking protocol we achieve a homogeneous\nelectronic performance within each Hall bar device through a fast and\nreproducible processing routine.

The most common way to accelerate DMs\ninvolves reducing the number of denoising steps during generation, achieved\nthrough faster sampling solvers or knowledge distillation (KD). In contrast to\nprior approaches, we propose a novel method that transfers the capability of\nlarge pretrained DMs to faster architectures. Specifically, we employ KD in a\ndistinct manner to compress DMs by distilling their generative ability into\nmore rapid variants. Furthermore, considering that the source data is either\nunaccessible or too enormous to store for current generative models, we\nintroduce a new paradigm for their distillation without source data, termed\nData-Free Knowledge Distillation for Diffusion Models (DKDM). Generally, our\nestablished DKDM framework comprises two main components: 1) a DKDM objective\nthat uses synthetic denoising data produced by pretrained DMs to optimize\nfaster DMs without source data, and 2) a dynamic iterative distillation method\nthat flexibly organizes the synthesis of denoising data, preventing it from\nslowing down the optimization process as the generation is slow. To our\nknowledge, this is the first attempt at using KD to distill DMs into any\narchitecture in a data-free manner. Importantly, our DKDM is orthogonal to most\nexisting acceleration methods, such as denoising step reduction, quantization\nand pruning. Experiments show that our DKDM is capable of deriving 2x faster\nDMs with performance remaining on par with the baseline.

We then demonstrate the idea of\ncompeting causal chains using a toy model adapted from ecological predator/prey\nrelationships. From this, we develop the alternative view that the study of\nempirical finance, and the risks contained therein, may be better appreciated\nonce we admit that our current arsenal of quantitative finance tools may be\nlimited to ex post causal inference under popular assumptions. Where these\nassumptions are challenged, for example in a recognizable reflexive context,\nthe prescription of unidirectional causation proves deeply problematic.",

            "summary": "This study investigates the application of machine learning algorithms,\nparticularly in the context of pricing American options using Monte Carlo\nsimulations. Traditional models, such as the Black-Scholes-Merton framework,\noften fail to adequately address the complexities of American options, which\ninclude the ability for early exercise and non-linear payoff structures. By\nleveraging Monte Carlo methods in conjunction Least Square Method machine\nlearning was used. This research aims to improve the accuracy and efficiency of\noption pricing. The study evaluates several machine learning models, including\nneural networks and decision trees, highlighting their potential to outperform\ntraditional approaches. The results from applying machine learning algorithm in\nLSM indicate that integrating machine learning with Monte Carlo simulations can\nenhance pricing accuracy and provide more robust predictions, offering\nsignificant insights into quantitative finance by merging classical financial\ntheories with modern computational techniques. The dataset was split into\nfeatures and the target variable representing bid prices, with an 80-20\ntrain-validation split. LSTM and GRU models were constructed using TensorFlow's\nKeras API, each with four hidden layers of 200 neurons and an output layer for\nbid price prediction, optimized with the Adam optimizer and MSE loss function.\nThe GRU model outperformed the LSTM model across all evaluated metrics,\ndemonstrating lower mean absolute error, mean squared error, and root mean\nsquared error, along with greater stability and efficiency in training.",
