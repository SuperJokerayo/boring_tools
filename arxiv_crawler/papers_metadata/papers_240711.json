            "summary": "Physical systems in real life are inextricably linked to their surroundings\nand never completely separated from them. Truly closed systems do not exist.\nThe phenomenon of decoherence, which is brought about by the interaction with\nthe environment, removes the relative phase of quantum states in superposition\nand makes them incoherent. In neutrino physics, decoherence, although\nextensively studied has only been analyzed thus far, exclusively in terms of\nits dissipative characteristics. While it is true that dissipation, or the\nexponential suppression, eventually is the main observable effect, the exchange\nof energy between the medium and the system, is an important factor that has\nbeen overlooked up until now. In this work, we introduce this term and analyze\nits consequences.",

            "summary": "Predictive models are a crucial component of many robotic systems. Yet,\nconstructing accurate predictive models for a variety of deformable objects,\nespecially those with unknown physical properties, remains a significant\nchallenge. This paper introduces AdaptiGraph, a learning-based dynamics\nmodeling approach that enables robots to predict, adapt to, and control a wide\narray of challenging deformable materials with unknown physical properties.\nAdaptiGraph leverages the highly flexible graph-based neural dynamics (GBND)\nframework, which represents material bits as particles and employs a graph\nneural network (GNN) to predict particle motion. Its key innovation is a\nunified physical property-conditioned GBND model capable of predicting the\nmotions of diverse materials with varying physical properties without\nretraining. Upon encountering new materials during online deployment,\nAdaptiGraph utilizes a physical property optimization process for a few-shot\nadaptation of the model, enhancing its fit to the observed interaction data.\nThe adapted models can precisely simulate the dynamics and predict the motion\nof various deformable materials, such as ropes, granular media, rigid boxes,\nand cloth, while adapting to different physical properties, including\nstiffness, granular size, and center of pressure. On prediction and\nmanipulation tasks involving a diverse set of real-world deformable objects,\nour method exhibits superior prediction accuracy and task proficiency over\nnon-material-conditioned and non-adaptive models.

This framework incorporates prior\ntrajectory-based sampling methods, such as diffusion models or Schr\\\"odinger\nbridges, without relying on the concept of time-reversals. Moreover, it allows\nus to propose novel numerical methods for solving the transport task and thus\nsampling from complicated targets without the need for the normalization\nconstant or data samples. We employ physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) to\napproximate the respective PDE solutions, implying both conceptional and\ncomputational advantages. In particular, PINNs allow for simulation- and\ndiscretization-free optimization and can be trained very efficiently, leading\nto significantly better mode coverage in the sampling task compared to\nalternative methods. Moreover, they can readily be fine-tuned with Gauss-Newton\nmethods to achieve high accuracy in sampling.",

The disturbance storm-time (Dst) index measures storm\nintensity. Despite advancements in empirical, physics-based, and\nmachine-learning models using real-time solar wind data, accurately forecasting\nextreme geomagnetic events remains challenging due to noise and sensor\nfailures. This research introduces TriQXNet, a novel hybrid classical-quantum\nneural network for Dst forecasting. Our model integrates classical and quantum\ncomputing, conformal prediction, and explainable AI (XAI) within a hybrid\narchitecture. To ensure high-quality input data, we developed a comprehensive\npreprocessing pipeline that included feature selection, normalization,\naggregation, and imputation. TriQXNet processes preprocessed solar wind data\nfrom NASA's ACE and NOAA's DSCOVR satellites, predicting the Dst index for the\ncurrent hour and the next, providing vital advance notice to mitigate\ngeomagnetic storm impacts. TriQXNet outperforms 13 state-of-the-art hybrid\ndeep-learning models, achieving a root mean squared error of 9.27 nanoteslas\n(nT). Rigorous evaluation through 10-fold cross-validated paired t-tests\nconfirmed its superior performance with 95% confidence. Conformal prediction\ntechniques provide quantifiable uncertainty, which is essential for operational\ndecisions, while XAI methods like ShapTime enhance interpretability.\nComparative analysis shows TriQXNet's superior forecasting accuracy, setting a\nnew level of expectations for geomagnetic storm prediction and highlighting the\npotential of classical-quantum hybrid models in space weather forecasting.",

We show that imposing this physical requirement\nleads to inhibition of the splitting between the chiral and confining\ntransitions, which becomes negligibly small ($\\Delta T \\sim 1$~MeV or less) for\nexperimentally relevant, slow angular velocities $\\Omega \\sim 10$~MeV of a\n$(5-10)$~fm-sized systems. Moreover, the boundedness of the system has a much\nbigger effect on temperature splitting than the rotation itself: the splitting\nreaches 10~MeV in a small, one-fermi-sized non-rotating system. The temperature\nsplitting may, however, become enhanced in an academic limit of\nultra-relativistic regimes when the boundary of the system rotates at\nnear-to-light velocities.",

On the\nstructural side, we show that nilspace theory (the algebraic part of\nhigher-order Fourier analysis) can be naturally extended to include all\nnon-commutative groups. To this end, we introduce generalized nilspaces called\n\"groupspaces\" and demonstrate that they possess properties very similar to\nnilspaces. We study $k$-th order generalizations of groups that are special\ngroupspaces called {\\it k-step} groupspaces. One step groupspaces are groups.\nWe show that $k$-step groupspaces admit the structure of an iterated principal\nbundle with structure groups $G_1,G_2,\\dots,G_k$. A similar, but somewhat more\ntechnical statement holds for general groupspaces, with possibly infinitely\nmany structure groups. Structure groups of groupspaces are in some sense\nanalogous to higher homotopy groups. In particular we use a version of the\nEckmann-Hilton argument from homotopy theory to show that $G_i$ is abelian for\n$i\\geq 2$.
