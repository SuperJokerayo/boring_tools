            "summary": "Understanding thermalisation in quantum many-body systems is among the most\nenduring problems in modern physics. A particularly interesting question\nconcerns the role played by quantum mechanics in this process, i.e. whether\nthermalisation in quantum many-body systems is fundamentally different from\nthat in classical many-body systems and, if so, which of its features are\ngenuinely quantum. Here we study this question in minimally structured\nmany-body systems which are only constrained to have local interactions, i.e.\nlocal random circuits. We introduce a class of random permutation circuits\n(RPCs), where the gates locally permute basis states modelling generic\nmicroscopic classical dynamics, and compare them to random unitary circuits\n(RUCs), a standard toy model for generic quantum dynamics. We show that, like\nRUCs, RPCs permit the analytical computation of several key quantities such as\nout-of-time order correlators (OTOCs), or entanglement entropies. RPCs can be\ninterpreted both as quantum or classical dynamics, which we use to find\nsimilarities and differences between the two. Performing the average over all\nrandom circuits, we discover a series of exact relations, connecting quantities\nin RUC and (quantum) RPCs. In the classical setting, we obtain similar exact\nresults relating (quantum) purity to (classical) growth of mutual information\nand (quantum) OTOCs to (classical) decorrelators. Our results indicate that\ndespite of the fundamental differences between quantum and classical systems,\ntheir dynamics exhibits qualitatively similar behaviours.",

            "summary": "To better understand the collisionless dark matter flow on different scales,\nstatistical theory involving kinematic and dynamic relations must be developed\nfor different types of flow, e.g. incompressible, constant divergence, and\nirrotational flow. This paper extends our previous work on the second-order\nstatistics (Phys. Fluids 35, 077105) to high order statistics. Kinematic and\ndynamic relations were developed for dark matter flow on different scales. The\nresults were validated by N-body simulations. On large scales, we found i)\nthird-order velocity correlations can be related to density correlation or\npairwise velocity; ii) the $p$th-order velocity correlations follow $\\propto\na^{(p+2)/2}$ for odd $p$ and $\\propto a^{p/2}$ for even $p$, where $a$ is the\nscale factor; iii) the overdensity $\\delta$ is proportional to density\ncorrelation on the same scale; iv) velocity dispersion on a given scale $r$ is\nproportional to the overdensity on the same scale. On small scales, i) a\nself-closed velocity evolution is developed by decomposing the velocity into\nmotion in haloes and motion of haloes; ii) the evolution of vorticity and\nenstrophy are derived from the evolution of velocity; iii) dynamic relations\nare derived to relate second- and third-order correlations; iv) while the first\nmoment of pairwise velocity follows $\\langle\\Delta u_L\\rangle=-Har$ ($H$ is the\nHubble parameter), the third moment follows $\\langle(\\Delta\nu_L)^3\\rangle\\propto\\varepsilon_uar$ that can be directly compared with\nsimulations and observations, where $\\varepsilon_u\\approx10^{-7}$m$^2$/s$^3$ is\nthe constant rate for energy cascade; v) the $p$th order velocity correlations\nfollow $\\propto a^{(3p-5)/4}$ for odd $p$ and $\\propto a^{3p/4}$ for even $p$.\nFinally, the combined kinematic and dynamic relations lead to exponential and\none-fourth power-law velocity correlations on large and small scales,\nrespectively.",

In machine learning, the answer is almost universally\ngiven by the error backpropagation algorithm, through both space and time.\nHowever, this algorithm is well-known to rely on biologically implausible\nassumptions, in particular with respect to spatio-temporal (non-)locality.\nAlternative forward-propagation models such as real-time recurrent learning\nonly partially solve the locality problem, but only at the cost of scaling, due\nto prohibitive storage requirements.\n  We introduce Generalized Latent Equilibrium (GLE), a computational framework\nfor fully local spatio-temporal credit assignment in physical, dynamical\nnetworks of neurons. We start by defining an energy based on neuron-local\nmismatches, from which we derive both neuronal dynamics via stationarity and\nparameter dynamics via gradient descent. The resulting dynamics can be\ninterpreted as a real-time, biologically plausible approximation of\nbackpropagation through space and time in deep cortical networks with\ncontinuous-time neuronal dynamics and continuously active, local synaptic\nplasticity. In particular, GLE exploits the morphology of dendritic trees to\nenable more complex information storage and processing in single neurons, as\nwell as the ability of biological neurons to phase-shift their output rate with\nrespect to their membrane potential, which is essential in both directions of\ninformation propagation. For the forward computation, it enables the mapping of\ntime-continuous inputs to neuronal space, effectively performing a\nspatio-temporal convolution.

Our training consists of two steps: (1) training a\nshallow autoencoder to project the segmentation masks to latent space; (2)\ntraining a diffusion model to allow image-conditioned sampling in latent space.\nThis generative approach unlocks the exploration of mask completion or\ninpainting. The experimental validation on COCO and ADE20k yields strong\nsegmentation results. Finally, we demonstrate our model's adaptability to\nmulti-tasking by introducing learnable task embeddings.",

            "summary": "Machine unlearning methods seek to revise pretrained models such that effects\nof certain training samples can be removed. In addition to effective erasure,\nlow computational cost and general utility retention are also highly desirable.\nExisting unlearning methods usually involve iterative updates over the model\nparameters, which incurs a high computational cost. In this work, we propose an\nefficient method that only requires a one-time gradient computation, with which\nwe modify only a single layer of model parameters. Specifically, we first\nidentify a small number of model layers that lie on the Pareto front of high\nforget importance and low retain influence as critical layers. Then we search\nfor a suitable step size and take a step along the gradient direction of a\nsingle critical layer while keeping other layers frozen. This method is highly\nmodular and can be used to unlearn multiple concepts simultaneously in a\ncontrollable manner. We demonstrate the effectiveness and efficiency of this\nmethod on various models including CLIP, stable diffusion, and VLMs, surpassing\nother state-of-the-art methods.",

            "summary": "Research in quantitative finance has demonstrated that reinforcement learning\n(RL) methods have delivered promising outcomes in the context of hedging\nfinancial portfolios. For example, hedging a portfolio of European options\nusing RL achieves better $PnL$ distribution than the trading hedging strategies\nlike Delta neutral and Delta-Gamma neutral [Cao et. al. 2020]. There is great\nattention given to the hedging of vanilla options, however, very little is\nmentioned on hedging a portfolio of structured products such as Autocallable\nnotes. Hedging structured products is much more complex and the traditional RL\napproaches tend to fail in this context due to the underlying complexity of\nthese products. These are more complicated due to presence of several barriers\nand coupon payments, and having a longer maturity date (from $7$ years to a\ndecade), etc. In this direction, we propose a distributional RL based method to\nhedge a portfolio containing an Autocallable structured note. We will\ndemonstrate our RL hedging strategy using American and Digital options as\nhedging instruments. Through several empirical analysis, we will show that\ndistributional RL provides better $PnL$ distribution than traditional\napproaches and learns a better policy depicting lower value-at-risk ($VaR$) and\nconditional value-at-risk ($CVaR$), showcasing the potential for enhanced risk\nmanagement.",

Many user queries contain quantities and\ncannot be resolved without understanding their semantics, e.g., ``car that\ncosts less than $10k''. Yet, modern search engines apply the same ranking\nmechanisms for both words and quantities, overlooking magnitude and unit\ninformation. In this paper, we introduce two quantity-aware ranking techniques\ndesigned to rank both the quantity and textual content either jointly or\nindependently. These techniques incorporate quantity information in available\nretrieval systems and can address queries with numerical conditions equal,\ngreater than, and less than. To evaluate the effectiveness of our proposed\nmodels, we introduce two novel quantity-aware benchmark datasets in the domains\nof finance and medicine and compare our method against various lexical and\nneural models.
