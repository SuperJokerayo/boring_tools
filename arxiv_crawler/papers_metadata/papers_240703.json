This work\nformalizes the problem of style-aware drag-and-drop and presents a method for\ntackling it by addressing two sub-problems: style-aware personalization and\nrealistic object insertion in stylized images. For style-aware personalization,\nour method first fine-tunes a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model using\nLoRA and learned text tokens on the subject image, and then infuses it with a\nCLIP representation of the target style. For object insertion, we use\nBootstrapped Domain Adaption to adapt a domain-specific photorealistic object\ninsertion model to the domain of diverse artistic styles. Overall, the method\nsignificantly outperforms traditional approaches such as inpainting. Finally,\nwe present a dataset, SubjectPlop, to facilitate evaluation and future progress\nin this area.

Therein, it\nwas shown that when the Weak Energy Condition is violated, the topology of\nspacetime in scalar-tensor gravity is altered, enabling the formation of\ntwo-way traversable wormholes. Furthermore, each of these wormholes acts a\ngateway between two $\\textit{time-mirrored}$ worlds, where the two\nasymptotically flat sheets in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram are glued\nantipodally along $\\textit{three}$ directions -- time $t$ and the polar and\nazimuth angles $(\\theta,\\,\\varphi)$ of the 2-sphere -- to form a wormhole\nthroat. This contrasts with the standard embedding diagram which typically\nglues the sheets only along the $\\theta$ and $\\varphi$ directions. Crucially,\ndue to the `gluing' along the $t$ direction, the wormhole becomes a portal\nconnecting the two spacetime sheets with $\\textit{opposite}$ physical time\nflows, enabling the emergence of closed timelike loops which straddle the\nthroat. We shall point out that this portal $\\textit{mathematically}$ permits\nthe possibility of backward propagation of information $\\textit{against}$ time.\nThis feature is ubiquitous for wormholes in scalar-tensor theories. In\naddition, we formulate the Feynman sum for transition amplitudes of microscopic\nparticles in the proximity of a wormhole throat in which we account for\ntimelike paths that experience time reversal.",

However, robust predictions of such\ntimescales are only available for certain cases. Inspired by the harmonic\ntheory of Langer, we derive a general activation rate for multi-dimensional\nspin systems. Assuming local thermal equilibrium in the initial minimum and\nderiving an expression for the flow of probability density along the real\nunstable dynamical mode at the saddle point, we obtain the expression for the\nactivation rate that is a function of the Gilbert damping parameter, $\\alpha$.\nWe find that this expression remains valid for the physically relevant regime\nof $\\alpha\\ll1$. When the activation is characterized by a coherent\nreorientation of all spins, we gain insight into the prefactor of the Arrhenius\nlaw by writing it in terms of spin wave frequencies and, for the case of a\nfinite antiferromagnetic spin chain, obtain an expression that depends\nexponentially on the square of the system size indicating a break-down of the\nMeyer-Neldel rule.",

            "summary": "Collective phenomena in physics emerge from interactions among numerous\ncomponents in a complex system, leading to behaviors distinct from those of\nindividual parts. This domain includes classical phenomena like synchronization\nand extends to quantum phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation and\nsuper-radiance. Studying these phenomena in controlled artificial systems\nallows for simulating complex natural systems. Solid-state mechanical\noscillators, controllable via optomechanical coupling, have been proposed for\nexploring collective phenomena, but experimental realizations face the\nchallenge of requiring nearly degenerate mechanical oscillators. In this work,\nwe present the collective behavior of six mechanical oscillators coupled to a\ncommon cavity in a superconducting circuit optomechanical platform. We\nexperimentally demonstrate that increasing the optomechanical coupling rates\ninduces a transition from individual mechanical oscillators to a collective\nmode, characterized by equal amplitude and relative phase of the oscillators.\nBy utilizing the finite non-degeneracy of mechanical frequencies and rapidly\nquenching the optomechanical couplings, we directly measure the amplitude and\nrelative phase of the oscillators in the collective mode. We find that the\ncoupling rate of such mode to the cavity increases with the number of coupled\noscillators, similar to a Tavis-Cummings system. Further increasing the\ncoupling rates pushes this collective mode into the strong coupling regime with\nthe cavity. We demonstrate sideband ground-state cooling of the collective\nmode, achieving a 0.4 quanta occupation, and observe quantum sideband asymmetry\nfor this mode. Observing collective optomechanical phenomena in the quantum\nregime opens avenues for studying synchronization, investigating topological\nphases of sound, and achieving multipartite phonon-phonon and photon-phonon\nentanglement.",

To tackle this issue, we propose CAGAD -- an unsupervised\nCounterfactual data Augmentation method for Graph Anomaly Detection -- which\nintroduces a graph pointer neural network as the heterophilic node detector to\nidentify potential anomalies whose neighborhoods are normal-node-dominant. For\neach identified potential anomaly, we design a graph-specific diffusion model\nto translate a part of its neighbors, which are probably normal, into anomalous\nones. At last, we involve these translated neighbors in GNN neighborhood\naggregation to produce counterfactual representations of anomalies. Through\naggregating the translated anomalous neighbors, counterfactual representations\nbecome more distinguishable and further advocate detection performance.
