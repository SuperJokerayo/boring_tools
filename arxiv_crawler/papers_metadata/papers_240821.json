Among such quantum algorithms,\nanomaly detection represents an important problem crossing several disciplines\nfrom cybersecurity, to fraud detection to particle physics. We summarize the\nkey concepts involved in quantum computing, introducing the formal concept of\nquantum speed up. The survey provides a structured map of anomaly detection\nbased on quantum machine learning.

            "summary": "Solitons in two-dimensional quantum field theory exhibit patterns of\ndegeneracies and associated selection rules on scattering amplitudes. We\ndevelop a representation theory that captures these intriguing features of\nsolitons. This representation theory is based on an algebra we refer to as the\n\"strip algebra\", $\\textrm{Str}_{\\mathcal{C}}(\\mathcal{M})$, which is defined in\nterms of the non-invertible symmetry, $\\mathcal{C},$ a fusion category, and its\naction on boundary conditions encoded by a module category, $\\mathcal{M}$. The\nstrip algebra is a $C^*$-weak Hopf algebra, a fact which can be elegantly\ndeduced by quantizing the three-dimensional Drinfeld center TQFT,\n$\\mathcal{Z}(\\mathcal{C}),$ on a spatial manifold with corners. These\nstructures imply that the representation category of the strip algebra is also\na unitary fusion category which we identify with a dual category\n$\\mathcal{C}_{\\mathcal{M}}^{*}.$ We present a straightforward method for\nanalyzing these representations in terms of quiver diagrams where nodes are\nvacua and arrows are solitons and provide examples demonstrating how the\nrepresentation theory reproduces known degeneracies and selection rules of\nsoliton scattering. Our analysis provides the general framework for analyzing\nnon-invertible symmetry on manifolds with boundary and applies both to the case\nof boundaries at infinity, relevant to particle physics, and boundaries at\nfinite distance, relevant in conformal field theory or condensed matter\nsystems.",

Large deep neural networks are poised to revolutionize weather\nprediction, which requires 3D modeling of the atmosphere. While similar in this\nregard, atmospheric transport modeling is subject to new challenges. Both,\nstable predictions for longer time horizons and mass conservation throughout\nneed to be achieved, while IO plays a larger role compared to computational\ncosts. In this study we explore four different deep neural networks (UNet,\nGraphCast, Spherical Fourier Neural Operator and SwinTransformer) which have\nproven as state-of-the-art in weather prediction to assess their usefulness for\natmospheric tracer transport modeling. For this, we assemble the CarbonBench\ndataset, a systematic benchmark tailored for machine learning emulators of\nEulerian atmospheric transport. Through architectural adjustments, we decouple\nthe performance of our emulators from the distribution shift caused by a steady\nrise in atmospheric CO$_2$. More specifically, we center CO$_2$ input fields to\nzero mean and then use an explicit flux scheme and a mass fixer to assure mass\nbalance. This design enables stable and mass conserving transport for over 6\nmonths with all four neural network architectures. In our study, the\nSwinTransformer displays particularly strong emulation skill (90-day $R^2 >\n0.99$), with physically plausible emulation even for forward runs of multiple\nyears.

This\ncompilation is categorized into two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder\nMeasurements: This group comprises 19 recent measurements, primarily from the\npast four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic\ndistance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements: This category includes 31\nmeasurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale\nand the distance ladder approach. These are derived from diverse probes such as\nCosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, time-delay strong lensing,\nmegamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between\nthese two groups. The distance ladder-based measurements yield a weighted mean\n$H_0 = 72.76 \\pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, while the one-step measurements\nresult in a weighted mean $H_0 = 69.01 \\pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To\nquantify the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented a\nKolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which yielded a p-value of 0.000102. This\nextremely low p-value strongly indicates that the two samples are fundamentally\ndistinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\\% that they are drawn from the\nsame underlying distribution. These findings suggest that late-time one-step\nmeasurements of $H_0$ are more consistent with early-time measurements,\nindicating that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early-time and\nlate-time measurements per se, but specifically between distance ladder\nmeasurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to\neither a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a\nfundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.",

Hence, physicians\nand researchers have relied on simple box-constraints, ignoring important\nanatomical factors. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to learn\nrealistic anatomically constrained upper-limb range of motion (RoM) boundaries\nfrom motion capture data. This is achieved by fitting a one-class support\nvector machine to a dataset of upper-limb joint space exploration motions with\nan efficient hyper-parameter tuning scheme.
