This thermalization process defines a natural,\nphysically-motivated model of quantum computation. However, whether quantum\ncomputational advantage can be achieved within this realistic physical setup\nhas remained open, due to the challenge of finding systems that thermalize\nquickly, but are classically intractable. Here we consider sampling from the\nmeasurement outcome distribution of quantum Gibbs states at constant\ntemperatures, and prove that this task demonstrates quantum computational\nadvantage. We design a family of commuting local Hamiltonians (parent\nHamiltonians of shallow quantum circuits) and prove that they rapidly converge\nto their Gibbs states under the standard physical model of thermalization (as a\ncontinuous-time quantum Markov chain). On the other hand, we show that no\npolynomial time classical algorithm can sample from the measurement outcome\ndistribution by reducing to the classical hardness of sampling from noiseless\nshallow quantum circuits. The key step in the reduction is constructing a\nfault-tolerance scheme for shallow IQP circuits against input noise.",

The new code uses a second-order accurate Boris\nintegrator and a predictor-predictor-corrector algorithm for advancing the\nHybrid-kinetic equations, using the constraint transport method to ensure that\nmagnetic fields are divergence-free. The code supports various interpolation\nschemes between the particles and grid cells, with post-interpolation smoothing\nto reduce finite particle noise. We further implement a $\\delta f$ method to\nstudy instabilities in weakly collisional plasmas. The new code is tested on\nstandard physical problems such as the motion of charged particles in uniform\nand spatially varying magnetic fields, the propagation of Alfv\\'en and whistler\nwaves, and Landau damping of ion acoustic waves. We test different\ninterpolation kernels and demonstrate the necessity of performing\npost-interpolation smoothing. We couple the $\\texttt{TurbGen}$ turbulence\ndriving module to the new Hybrid PIC code, allowing us to test the code on the\nhighly complex physical problem of the turbulent dynamo. To investigate\nsteady-state turbulence with a fixed sonic Mach number, it is important to\nmaintain isothermal plasma conditions. Therefore, we introduce a novel cooling\nmethod for Hybrid PIC codes and provide tests and calibrations of this method\nto keep the plasma isothermal. We describe and test the `hybrid precision'\nmethod, which significantly reduces (by a factor $\\sim1.5$) the computational\ncost, without compromising the accuracy of the numerical solutions. Finally, we\ntest the parallel scalability of the new code, showing excellent scaling up to\n10,000~cores.",

The misalignment of a\nstar's tidal bulge with its companion's gravitational field encodes the\nstrength of internal dissipative processes, which imprint onto the phase of the\ngravitational waves emitted. We here analyze GW data from the GW170817 (binary\nneutron star) event detected by LIGO and Virgo and find the first constraint on\nthe dissipative tidal deformability of a neutron star. From this constraint,\n\\emph{assuming} a temperature profile for each star in the binary, we obtain an\norder of magnitude bound on the averaged bulk ($\\zeta$) and shear ($\\eta$)\nviscosity of each star during the inspiral.: $\\zeta \\lesssim 10^{31}\n\\mathrm{g}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1}$ and $\\eta \\lesssim 10^{28}\n\\mathrm{g}\\;\\mathrm{cm}^{-1}\\mathrm{s}^{-1} $.
