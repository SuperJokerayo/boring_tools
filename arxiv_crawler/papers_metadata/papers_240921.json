            "summary": "For any local, translation-covariant quantum field theory on Minkowski\nspacetime, we prove that two distinct states that are invariant under the\ninertial time evolutions in different inertial reference frames are disjoint,\ni.e. neither state is a perturbation of the other, if the states are primary,\nhave separating Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) vectors, and satisfy a timelike\ncluster property called the mixing property. These conditions are fulfilled by\nthe inertial Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states of the free scalar field, thus\nshowing that a state satisfying the KMS condition relative to one inertial\nframe is far from thermal equilibrium relative to other inertial frames. We\nreview the property of return to equilibrium (RTE) in open quantum systems\ntheory and discuss the implications of disjointness on the asymptotic behavior\nof detector systems coupled to states of a free massless scalar field. We argue\nthat the coupled system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector moving with constant\nvelocity relative to the field in a KMS state, or an excitation thereof, cannot\nthermalize under generic conditions. This leads to an illustration of the\nphysical differences between heat baths in inertial systems and the alleged\n\"heat bath\" of the Unruh effect. This paper also sketches the construction and\nRTE property of the quantum dynamical system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector\ncoupled to a massless scalar field in a KMS state relative to the inertial rest\nframe of the detector.",

The exquisite precision of the\nmeasurement makes it particularly sensitive to small effects caused by hidden\nsector interactions. In particular, CMB spectral distortions can unveil the\nexistence of dark photons which are kinetically coupled to the standard photon.\nIn this work, we use the COBE-FIRAS dataset to derive accurate and robust\nlimits on photon-to-dark-photon oscillations for a large range of dark photon\nmasses, from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-4}$ eV. We consider in detail the redshift\ndependence of the bounds, computing CMB distortions due to photon\ninjection/removal using a Green's function method. Our treatment improves on\nprevious results, which had set limits studying energy injection/removal into\nbaryons rather than photon injection/removal, or ignored the redshift evolution\nof distortions. The difference between our treatment and previous ones is\nparticularly noticeable in the predicted spectral shape of the distortions, a\nsmoking gun signature for photon-to-dark-photon oscillations.

This Floquet-St\\v{r}eda response, which is a priori\nmathematically ill-defined, is regularized by means of a Ces\\`aro summation\nmethod. As a key outcome of this approach, we relate all relevant Floquet\nwinding numbers to simple band properties of the Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonian.\nThese general relations indicate how the topological characterization of\nFloquet systems can be entirely deduced from the stroboscopic time-evolution of\nthe driven system. Importantly, we identify two physically distinguishable\ncontributions to the Floquet-St\\v{r}eda response: a quantized flow of charge\nbetween the edge and the bulk of the system, and an 'anomalous' quantized flow\nof energy between the system and the driving field, which provides new insight\non the physical origin of the anomalous edge states. As byproducts, our theory\nprovides: a general relation between Floquet winding numbers and the orbital\nmagnetization of Floquet-Bloch bands; a local marker for Floquet winding\nnumbers, which allows to access Floquet topology in inhomogeneous samples; an\nexperimental protocol to extract these Floquet winding numbers from\ndensity-measurements in the presence of an engineered bath; as well as general\nexpressions for these topological invariants in terms of the magnetic response\nof the Floquet density of states, opening a route for the topological\ncharacterization of interacting Floquet systems.",
