**Abstract**: We report on the first deployment of a ytterbium (Yb) transportable optical
lattice clock (TOLC), commercially shipping the clock 3,000 km from Boulder,
Colorado to Washington DC. The system, composed of a rigidly mounted optical
reference cavity, atomic physics package, and an optical frequency comb, fully
realizes an independent frequency standard for comparisons in the optical and
microwave domains. The shipped Yb TOLC was fully operational within 2 days of
arrival, enabling frequency comparisons with rubidium (Rb) fountains at the
United States Naval Observatory (USNO). To the best of our knowledge, this
represents the first deployment of a fully independent TOLC, including the
frequency comb, coherently uniting the optical stability of the Yb TOLC to the
microwave output of the Rb fountain.

**Abstract**: Neural operators have recently grown in popularity as Partial Differential
Equation (PDE) surrogate models. Learning solution functionals, rather than
functions, has proven to be a powerful approach to calculate fast, accurate
solutions to complex PDEs. While much work has been done evaluating neural
operator performance on a wide variety of surrogate modeling tasks, these works
normally evaluate performance on a single equation at a time. In this work, we
develop a novel contrastive pretraining framework utilizing Generalized
Contrastive Loss that improves neural operator generalization across multiple
governing equations simultaneously. Governing equation coefficients are used to
measure ground-truth similarity between systems. A combination of
physics-informed system evolution and latent-space model output are anchored to
input data and used in our distance function. We find that physics-informed
contrastive pretraining improves accuracy for the Fourier Neural Operator in
fixed-future and autoregressive rollout tasks for the 1D and 2D Heat, Burgers',
and linear advection equations.


### Learning To Help: Training Models to Assist Legacy Devices

**Abstract**: Machine learning models implemented in hardware on physical devices may be
deployed for a long time. The computational abilities of the device may be
limited and become outdated with respect to newer improvements. Because of the
size of ML models, offloading some computation (e.g. to an edge cloud) can help
such legacy devices. We cast this problem in the framework of learning with
abstention (LWA) in which the expert (edge) must be trained to assist the
client (device). Prior work on LWA trains the client assuming the edge is
either an oracle or a human expert. In this work, we formalize the reverse
problem of training the expert for a fixed (legacy) client. As in LWA, the
client uses a rejection rule to decide when to offload inference to the expert
(at a cost). We find the Bayes-optimal rule, prove a generalization bound, and
find a consistent surrogate loss function. Empirical results show that our
framework outperforms confidence-based rejection rules.

**Abstract**: This article outlines a comprehensive redesign of an introductory physics
laboratory course aimed at promoting active student engagement, enhancing
scientific experimental skills and the development of expert-like attitudes.
The redesign process involved redefining specific and measurable learning goals
and the development of tailored activities and assessment rubrics to reach and
assess those goals. In order to implement course scaffolding, we made
significant modifications to the previously existing course format, space,
physics topics contexts, and assessment. Instructors` roles evolved from
imparting knowledge to promoting student decision-making and fostering a
collaborative learning environment. To guide the laboratory transformation we
used the results of a research-based survey. This work offers practical
insights for educators seeking to redesign laboratory courses, emphasizing
authentic scientific practices and student-driven learning experiences in
physics education.


### Nearly degenerate ground states of a checkerboard antiferromagnet and their bosonic interpretation

**Abstract**: The spin-$1/2$ model system with antiferromagnetic (AF) couplings on a
$J_1$-$J_2$ checkerboard lattice, known as the planar pyrochlore model, is
strongly frustrated and associated with a two-to-one dimensional crossover.
Using the Projected Entangled Simplex States tensor network ansatz, we identify
a large number of nearly degenerate states in the frustrated region
($J_1<J_2$). Specifically, we find the long-sought crossed-dimer valence bond
solid (VBS) state to be the ground state at $J_1\lesssim J_2$, while various 1D
AF correlated states take over the rest. We verify the stability of the VBS
state against nematic perturbation. The corresponding bosonic picture provides
an intuitive understanding of the low-energy physics. Particularly, it predicts
weaker VBS states in the easy-plane limit, which we confirm numerically. Our
results clarify the most essential ground state properties of this interesting
system and demonstrate the usefulness of bosonic picture in dealing with
frustrated magnetism.

**Abstract**: We find that unitarity cuts and the duality between color and kinematics are
sufficient constraints to bootstrap $D$-dimensional QCD scattering amplitudes
starting from three-particle tree-level. Specifically, we calculate tree level
amplitudes through six-points, as well as the four-point one-loop correction
for massive fermions in the fundamental representation of the gauge group --
constructing a color-dual representation of the latter for the first time. To
do so we clarify a prescription for functional kinematic ansatze involving
fermionic matter. The advantages of color-dual calculation, familiar from
particles in the adjoint, also apply here: only a small number of basis
topologies must be constrained via physical information of the theory, and
algebraic relations propagate this to a full solution. As all the QCD
amplitudes we construct here are color-dual, they trivially generate
$D$-dimensional amplitudes in gravitational theories via double-copy
construction.

**Abstract**: We present a family of conditional dual auto-encoders (CoDAEs) for generic
and model-independent new physics searches at colliders. New physics signals,
which arise from new types of particles and interactions, are considered in our
study as anomalies causing deviations in data with respect to expected
background events. In this work, we perform a normal-only anomaly detection,
which employs only background samples, to search for manifestations of a dark
version of strong force applying (variational) auto-encoders on raw detector
images, which are large and highly sparse, without leveraging any physics-based
pre-processing or strong assumption on the signals. The proposed CoDAE has a
dual-encoder design, which is general and can learn an auxiliary yet compact
latent space through spatial conditioning, showing a neat improvement over
competitive physics-based baselines and related approaches, therefore also
reducing the gap with fully supervised models. It is the first time an
unsupervised model is shown to exhibit excellent discrimination against
multiple dark shower models, illustrating the suitability of this method as an
accurate, fast, model-independent algorithm to deploy, e.g., in the real-time
event triggering systems of Large Hadron Collider experiments such as ATLAS and
CMS.

**Abstract**: From cytoskeletal networks to tissues, many biological systems behave as
active materials. Their composition and stress-generation is affected by
chemical reaction networks. In such systems, the coupling between mechanics and
chemistry enables self-organization, for example, into waves. Recently,
contractile mechanochemical systems were shown to be able to spontaneously
develop localized spatial patterns. Here, we show that these localized patterns
can present intrinsic spatiotemporal dynamics, including oscillations and
chaotic-like dynamics. We discuss their physical origin and bifurcation
structure.


### Preparing Ground and Excited States Using Adiabatic CoVaR

**Abstract**: CoVarince Root finding with classical shadows (CoVaR) was recently introduced
as a new paradigm for training variational quantum circuits. Common approaches,
such as variants of the Variational Quantum Eigensolver, aim to optimise a
non-linear classical cost function and thus suffer from, e.g., poor local
minima, high shot requirements and barren plateaus. In contrast, CoVaR fully
exploits powerful classical shadows and finds joint roots of a very large
number of covariances using only a logarithmic number of shots and linearly
scaling classical HPC compute resources. As a result, CoVaR has been
demonstrated to be particularly robust against local traps, however, its main
limitation has been that it requires a sufficiently good initial state. We
address this limitation by introducing an adiabatic morphing of the target
Hamiltonian and demonstrate in a broad range of application examples that CoVaR
can successfully prepare eigenstates of the target Hamiltonian when no initial
warm start is known. CoVaR succeeds even when Hamiltonian energy gaps are very
small -- this is in stark contrast to adiabatic evolution and phase estimation
algorithms where circuit depths scale inversely with the Hamiltonian energy
gaps. On the other hand, when the energy gaps are relatively small then
adiabatic CoVaR may converge to higher excited states as opposed to a targeted
specific low-lying state. Nevertheless, we exploit this feature of adiabatic
CoVaR and demonstrate that it can be used to map out the low lying spectrum of
a Hamiltonian which can be useful in practical applications, such as estimating
thermal properties or in high-energy physics.

**Abstract**: The integration of the Internet of Things (IoT) into Cyber-Physical Systems
(CPSs) has expanded their cyber-attack surface, introducing new and
sophisticated threats with potential to exploit emerging vulnerabilities.
Assessing the risks of CPSs is increasingly difficult due to incomplete and
outdated cybersecurity knowledge. This highlights the urgent need for
better-informed risk assessments and mitigation strategies. While previous
efforts have relied on rule-based natural language processing (NLP) tools to
map vulnerabilities, weaknesses, and attack patterns, recent advancements in
Large Language Models (LLMs) present a unique opportunity to enhance
cyber-attack knowledge completion through improved reasoning, inference, and
summarization capabilities. We apply embedding models to encapsulate
information on attack patterns and adversarial techniques, generating mappings
between them using vector embeddings. Additionally, we propose a
Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)-based approach that leverages pre-trained
models to create structured mappings between different taxonomies of threat
patterns. Further, we use a small hand-labeled dataset to compare the proposed
RAG-based approach to a baseline standard binary classification model. Thus,
the proposed approach provides a comprehensive framework to address the
challenge of cyber-attack knowledge graph completion.

**Abstract**: Masked transformer models for class-conditional image generation have become
a compelling alternative to diffusion models. Typically comprising two stages -
an initial VQGAN model for transitioning between latent space and image space,
and a subsequent Transformer model for image generation within latent space -
these frameworks offer promising avenues for image synthesis. In this study, we
present two primary contributions: Firstly, an empirical and systematic
examination of VQGANs, leading to a modernized VQGAN. Secondly, a novel
embedding-free generation network operating directly on bit tokens - a binary
quantized representation of tokens with rich semantics. The first contribution
furnishes a transparent, reproducible, and high-performing VQGAN model,
enhancing accessibility and matching the performance of current
state-of-the-art methods while revealing previously undisclosed details. The
second contribution demonstrates that embedding-free image generation using bit
tokens achieves a new state-of-the-art FID of 1.52 on the ImageNet 256x256
benchmark, with a compact generator model of mere 305M parameters.

**Abstract**: Assessing the robustness of perception models to covariate shifts and their
ability to detect out-of-distribution (OOD) inputs is crucial for
safety-critical applications such as autonomous vehicles. By nature of such
applications, however, the relevant data is difficult to collect and annotate.
In this paper, we show for the first time how synthetic data can be
specifically generated to assess comprehensively the real-world reliability of
semantic segmentation models. By fine-tuning Stable Diffusion with only
in-domain data, we perform zero-shot generation of visual scenes in OOD domains
or inpainted with OOD objects. This synthetic data is employed to evaluate the
robustness of pretrained segmenters, thereby offering insights into their
performance when confronted with real edge cases. Through extensive
experiments, we demonstrate a high correlation between the performance of
models when evaluated on our synthetic OOD data and when evaluated on real OOD
inputs, showing the relevance of such virtual testing. Furthermore, we
demonstrate how our approach can be utilized to enhance the calibration and OOD
detection capabilities of segmenters. Code and data are made public.

### ASD-Diffusion: Anomalous Sound Detection with Diffusion Models

**PDF Url**: [2409.15957v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.15957v1)

**Abstract**: Unsupervised Anomalous Sound Detection (ASD) aims to design a generalizable
method that can be used to detect anomalies when only normal sounds are given.
In this paper, Anomalous Sound Detection based on Diffusion Models
(ASD-Diffusion) is proposed for ASD in real-world factories. In our pipeline,
the anomalies in acoustic features are reconstructed from their noisy corrupted
features into their approximate normal pattern. Secondly, a post-processing
anomalies filter algorithm is proposed to detect anomalies that exhibit
significant deviation from the original input after reconstruction.
Furthermore, denoising diffusion implicit model is introduced to accelerate the
inference speed by a longer sampling interval of the denoising process. The
proposed method is innovative in the application of diffusion models as a new
scheme. Experimental results on the development set of DCASE 2023 challenge
task 2 outperform the baseline by 7.75%, demonstrating the effectiveness of the
proposed method.


### Protein Conformation Generation via Force-Guided SE(3) Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: The conformational landscape of proteins is crucial to understanding their
functionality in complex biological processes. Traditional physics-based
computational methods, such as molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, suffer from
rare event sampling and long equilibration time problems, hindering their
applications in general protein systems. Recently, deep generative modeling
techniques, especially diffusion models, have been employed to generate novel
protein conformations. However, existing score-based diffusion methods cannot
properly incorporate important physical prior knowledge to guide the generation
process, causing large deviations in the sampled protein conformations from the
equilibrium distribution. In this paper, to overcome these limitations, we
propose a force-guided SE(3) diffusion model, ConfDiff, for protein
conformation generation. By incorporating a force-guided network with a mixture
of data-based score models, ConfDiff can generate protein conformations with
rich diversity while preserving high fidelity. Experiments on a variety of
protein conformation prediction tasks, including 12 fast-folding proteins and
the Bovine Pancreatic Trypsin Inhibitor (BPTI), demonstrate that our method
surpasses the state-of-the-art method.

**Abstract**: We present initial results of a forthcoming benchmark for evaluating LLM
agents on white-collar tasks of economic value. We evaluate eight realistic and
``messy'' tasks that are routine in finance and consulting, drawn from
real-world cases from our customers. We lay the groundwork for an LLM agent
evaluation suite where good performance directly corresponds to a large
economic and societal impact. This fills a gap in existing benchmarks with
tasks like ``order a pizza to the following address'' that do not constitute
real-human work of economic value. Our evaluations assign credit to agents for
partially solving tasks. By doing that, this initial evaluation, and the
forthcoming benchmark, allow us to more accurately extrapolate performance of
LLM-based agents on economically valuable tasks.
  We built and tested several architectures with GPT-4o, Claude-3.5 Sonnet,
Llama 3.1 (405b), and GPT-4o-mini, ensuring that failure to solve a task was
due to failures of reasoning and planning, rather than due to common failures
like e.g. the inability to parse a website. On average, LLM agents powered by
Claude-3.5 Sonnet substantially outperformed agents using GPT-4o, with agents
based on Llama 3.1 (405b) and GPT-4o-mini lagging noticeably behind. Across
LLMs, a ReAct architecture with the ability to delegate subtasks to subagents
performed best. In addition to quantitative evaluations, we qualitatively
assessed the performance of the LLM agents by inspecting their traces and
reflecting on their observations.
