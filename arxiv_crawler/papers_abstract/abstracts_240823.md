**Abstract**: We investigate a two-qubit open Rabi model, focusing on local ergotropy--the
maximum extractable work by acting solely on the two qubits--within a parameter
regime where a Berezinskii-Kosterlitz-Thouless dissipative phase transition
occurs. First, we aim to define a protocol for charging, storing, and
discharging the two-qubit system, interpreted as the working principle of an
open quantum battery. Second, we examine the impact of the phase transition on
ergotropy and identify potential markers. To achieve these goals, we construct
an ad-hoc charging unitary operator, leveraging our knowledge of the ground
state near the transition to bring it into a decoherence-free state during
storage. Using state-of-the-art numerics based on matrix product state
representation, we reveal that high couplings to an external bath approximately
double the local ergotropy immediately post-charging. Over time we observe
oscillatory behaviors in ergotropy and its fluctuations, which undergo
significant changes near the transition, signaling its occurrence. Furthermore,
we optimize local ergotropy over time using a physically inspired ansatz,
enabling work extraction at a generic time (local ergotropy never reaches
zero). Our work proposes a tunable, experimentally realizable protocol for work
extraction, leveraging decoherence-free states and phase transitions.
Additionally, it sheds light on the complex interaction between local ergotropy
and quantum phase transitions.

### Climate Bistability at the Inner Edge of the Habitable Zone due to Runaway Greenhouse and Cloud Feedbacks
**Authors**: Bowen Fan, Da Yang, Dorian S. Abbot

**PDF Url**: [2408.12563v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12563v1)

**Abstract**: Understanding the climate dynamics at the inner edge of the habitable zone
(HZ) is crucial for predicting the habitability of rocky exoplanets. Previous
studies using Global Climate Models (GCMs) have indicated that planets
receiving high stellar flux can exhibit climate bifurcations, leading to
bistability between a cold (temperate) and a hot (runaway) climate. However,
the mechanism causing this bistability has not been fully explained, in part
due to the difficulty associated with inferring mechanisms from small numbers
of expensive numerical simulations in GCMs. In this study, we employ a
two-column (dayside and nightside), two-layer climate model to investigate the
physical mechanisms driving this bistability. Through mechanism-denial
experiments, we demonstrate that the runaway greenhouse effect, coupled with a
cloud feedback on either the dayside or nightside, leads to climate
bistability. We also map out the parameters that control the location of the
bifurcations and size of the bistability. This work identifies which mechanisms
and GCM parameters control the stellar flux at which rocky planets are likely
to retain a hot, thick atmosphere if they experience a hot start. This is
critical for the prioritization of targets and interpretation of observations
by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST). Furthermore, our modeling framework
can be extended to planets with different condensable species and cloud types.

**PDF Url**: [2408.12562v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12562v1)

**Abstract**: In this work, we investigate braneworld models generated by scalar fields in
which one field has a split kink profile, in which a kink separates into two
kinklike configurations. Our analysis covers models with two and three fields,
examining the behavior of the most important quantities associated with the
brane, such as the warp factor and the stability of the corresponding gravity
sector. The results show that the brane is stable and supports a hybrid
character, behaving as a thin and thick configuration.


### Time arrow without past hypothesis: a toy model explanation
**Authors**: Pablo Arrighi, Gilles Dowek, Amélia Durbec

**Abstract**: The laws of Physics are time-reversible, making no qualitative distinction
between the past and the future -- yet we can only go towards the future. This
apparent contradiction is known as the "arrow of time problem". Its current
resolution states that the future is the direction of increasing entropy. But
entropy can only increase towards the future if it was low in the past, and
past low entropy is a very strong assumption to make, because low entropy
states are rather improbable, non-generic. Recent works from the Physics
literature suggest, however, we may do away with this so-called "past
hypothesis", in the presence of reversible dynamical laws featuring expansion.
We prove that this can be the case in principle, within a toy model. It
consists in graphs upon which particles circulate and interact according to
local reversible rules. Some rules locally shrink or expand the graph. We prove
that almost all states expand; entropy always increases as a consequence of
expansion -- thereby providing a local explanation for the rise of an entropic
arrow of time without the need for a past hypothesis. The discrete setting of
this toy model allows us to deploy the full rigour of theoretical Computer
Science proof techniques. It also allows for the numerical exploration of
several physically-motivated variants: a time-symmetric variant; two
inflationary variants; and a damping variant -- which slows down thermal death.
The fact that all of these models exhibit similar behaviours suggests that
local reversible expansion mechanisms constitute a robust recipe for a time
arrow without past hypothesis. In this qualitative sense, the explanation may
therefore also be relevant at the cosmological level.

**PDF Url**: [2408.12545v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12545v1)

**Abstract**: Gradient-based meta-learning algorithms have gained popularity for their
ability to train models on new tasks using limited data. Empirical observations
indicate that such algorithms are able to learn a shared representation across
tasks, which is regarded as a key factor in their success. However, the
in-depth theoretical understanding of the learning dynamics and the origin of
the shared representation remains underdeveloped. In this work, we investigate
the meta-learning dynamics of the non-linear two-layer neural networks trained
on streaming tasks in the teach-student scenario. Through the lens of
statistical physics analysis, we characterize the macroscopic behavior of the
meta-training processes, the formation of the shared representation, and the
generalization ability of the model on new tasks. The analysis also points to
the importance of the choice of certain hyper-parameters of the learning
algorithms.


### Approximating the eigenvalues of self-adjoint trace-class operators

**PDF Url**: [2407.04478v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.04478v2)

**Abstract**: Spectral properties of bounded linear operators play a crucial role in
several areas of mathematics and physics. For each self-adjoint, trace-class
operator $O$ we define a set $\Lambda_n\subset \mathbb{R}$, and we show that it
converges to the spectrum of $O$ in the Hausdorff metric under mild conditions.
Our set $\Lambda_n$ only depends on the first $n$ moments of $O$. We show that
it can be effectively calculated for physically relevant operators, and it
approximates the spectrum well.
  We prove that using the above method we can converge to the minimal and
maximal eigenvalues with super-exponential speed.
  We also construct monotone increasing lower bounds $q_n$ for the minimal
eigenvalue (or decreasing upper bounds for the maximal eigenvalue). This
sequence only depends on the moments of $O$ and a concrete upper estimate of
its $1$-norm; we also demonstrate that $q_n$ can be effectively calculated for
a large class of physically relevant operators. This rigorous lower bound $q_n$
tends to the minimal eigenvalue with super-exponential speed provided that $O$
is not positive semidefinite. As a by-product, we obtain computable upper
bounds for the $1$-norm of $O$, too.

**Abstract**: Survival analysis is a fundamental area of focus in biomedical research,
particularly in the context of personalized medicine. This prominence is due to
the increasing prevalence of large and high-dimensional datasets, such as omics
and medical image data. However, the literature on non-linear regression
algorithms and variable selection techniques for interval-censoring is either
limited or non-existent, particularly in the context of neural networks. Our
objective is to introduce a novel predictive framework tailored for
interval-censored regression tasks, rooted in Accelerated Failure Time (AFT)
models. Our strategy comprises two key components: i) a variable selection
phase leveraging recent advances on sparse neural network architectures, ii) a
regression model targeting prediction of the interval-censored response. To
assess the performance of our novel algorithm, we conducted a comprehensive
evaluation through both numerical experiments and real-world applications that
encompass scenarios related to diabetes and physical activity. Our results
outperform traditional AFT algorithms, particularly in scenarios featuring
non-linear relationships.

**Abstract**: The confinement of ultracold neutrons (UCNs) in a three dimensional magnetic
field gradient trap allows for a measurement of the free neutron lifetime with
superior control over spurious loss channels and can provide a large kinetic
energy acceptance to enhance statistical sensitivity. In this paper, we present
the first successful implementation of a pulsed spin-flip based loading scheme
for a three-dimensional magnetic UCN trap. The measurements with the
$\tau$SPECT experiment were performed at the pulsed UCN source of the research
reactor TRIGA Mainz. We report on detailed investigations of major systematic
effects influencing the neutron storage time, statistically limited by the size
of the recorded data set. The extracted neutron storage time constant of $\tau
= 859(16)\mathrm{s}$ is compatible with, but not to be interpreted as, a
measurement of the free neutron lifetime.

**Abstract**: Neutral triple gauge couplings (nTGCs) are manifestation of new physics
beyond the Standard Model (SM), as they are absent in the SM and are first
generated by dimension-8 operators in the SM Effective Field Theory (SMEFT). We
study the UV completion of nTGCs in a renormalizable model with vector-like
heavy fermions. We compute the one-loop heavy fermion contributions to nTGC
vertices by matching them to dimension-8 operators in the low energy limit.
Such fermion loops contain either heavy fermions only or mixture of heavy
fermions with light SM fermions. We find that their contributions can induce
dimension-8 nTGC effective operators containing two SM Higgs-doublet fields,
which are formulated with a complete set of 7 dimension-8 operators generating
off-shell CP-even nTGCs. We present the results in terms of SMEFT coefficients
and in terms of nTGC vertices (form factors) with two on-shell gauge bosons. In
the heavy-light mixing case there appear terms that cannot be accommodated by
conventional parametrizations of form factors due to extra logarithmic
corrections. We further discuss the implications for probing such UV dynamics
via nTGCs at the high energy colliders.

**PDF Url**: [2408.12590v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12590v1)

**Abstract**: We present xGen-VideoSyn-1, a text-to-video (T2V) generation model capable of
producing realistic scenes from textual descriptions. Building on recent
advancements, such as OpenAI's Sora, we explore the latent diffusion model
(LDM) architecture and introduce a video variational autoencoder (VidVAE).
VidVAE compresses video data both spatially and temporally, significantly
reducing the length of visual tokens and the computational demands associated
with generating long-sequence videos. To further address the computational
costs, we propose a divide-and-merge strategy that maintains temporal
consistency across video segments. Our Diffusion Transformer (DiT) model
incorporates spatial and temporal self-attention layers, enabling robust
generalization across different timeframes and aspect ratios. We have devised a
data processing pipeline from the very beginning and collected over 13M
high-quality video-text pairs. The pipeline includes multiple steps such as
clipping, text detection, motion estimation, aesthetics scoring, and dense
captioning based on our in-house video-LLM model. Training the VidVAE and DiT
models required approximately 40 and 642 H100 days, respectively. Our model
supports over 14-second 720p video generation in an end-to-end way and
demonstrates competitive performance against state-of-the-art T2V models.

**PDF Url**: [2408.12561v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12561v1)

**Abstract**: Recently, deep learning has made remarkable strides, especially with
generative modeling, such as large language models and probabilistic diffusion
models. However, training these models often involves significant computational
resources, requiring billions of petaFLOPs. This high resource consumption
results in substantial energy usage and a large carbon footprint, raising
critical environmental concerns. Back-propagation (BP) is a major source of
computational expense during training deep learning models. To advance research
on energy-efficient training and allow for sparse learning on any machine and
device, we propose a general, energy-efficient convolution module that can be
seamlessly integrated into any deep learning architecture. Specifically, we
introduce channel-wise sparsity with additional gradient selection schedulers
during backward based on the assumption that BP is often dense and inefficient,
which can lead to over-fitting and high computational consumption. Our
experiments demonstrate that our approach reduces 40\% computations while
potentially improving model performance, validated on image classification and
generation tasks. This reduction can lead to significant energy savings and a
lower carbon footprint during the research and development phases of
large-scale AI systems. Additionally, our method mitigates over-fitting in a
manner distinct from Dropout, allowing it to be combined with Dropout to
further enhance model performance and reduce computational resource usage.
Extensive experiments validate that our method generalizes to a variety of
datasets and tasks and is compatible with a wide range of deep learning
architectures and modules. Code is publicly available at

### Diff-Cleanse: Identifying and Mitigating Backdoor Attacks in Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Jiang Hao, Xiao Jin, Hu Xiaoguang, Chen Tianyou, Zhao Jiajia

**Published Date**: 2024-07-31

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-22

**PDF Url**: [2407.21316v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.21316v2)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models (DMs) are regarded as one of the most advanced generative
models today, yet recent studies suggest that they are vulnerable to backdoor
attacks, which establish hidden associations between particular input patterns
and model behaviors, compromising model integrity by causing undesirable
actions with manipulated inputs. This vulnerability poses substantial risks,
including reputational damage to model owners and the dissemination of harmful
content. To mitigate the threat of backdoor attacks, there have been some
investigations on backdoor detection and model repair. However, previous work
fails to reliably purify the models backdoored by state-of-the-art attack
methods, rendering the field much underexplored. To bridge this gap, we
introduce Diff-Cleanse, a novel two-stage backdoor defense framework
specifically designed for DMs. The first stage employs a novel trigger
inversion technique to reconstruct the trigger and detect the backdoor, and the
second stage utilizes a structural pruning method to eliminate the backdoor. We
evaluate our framework on hundreds of DMs that are attacked by three existing
backdoor attack methods with a wide range of hyperparameter settings. Extensive
experiments demonstrate that Diff-Cleanse achieves nearly 100\% detection
accuracy and effectively mitigates backdoor impacts, preserving the model's
benign performance with minimal compromise. Our code is avaliable at

### 4D Diffusion for Dynamic Protein Structure Prediction with Reference Guided Motion Alignment
**Authors**: Kaihui Cheng, Ce Liu, Qingkun Su, Jun Wang, Liwei Zhang, Yining Tang, Yao Yao, Siyu Zhu, Yuan Qi

**Published Date**: 2024-08-22

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-22

**PDF Url**: [2408.12419v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12419v1)

**Abstract**: Protein structure prediction is pivotal for understanding the
structure-function relationship of proteins, advancing biological research, and
facilitating pharmaceutical development and experimental design. While deep
learning methods and the expanded availability of experimental 3D protein
structures have accelerated structure prediction, the dynamic nature of protein
structures has received limited attention. This study introduces an innovative
4D diffusion model incorporating molecular dynamics (MD) simulation data to
learn dynamic protein structures. Our approach is distinguished by the
following components: (1) a unified diffusion model capable of generating
dynamic protein structures, including both the backbone and side chains,
utilizing atomic grouping and side-chain dihedral angle predictions; (2) a
reference network that enhances structural consistency by integrating the
latent embeddings of the initial 3D protein structures; and (3) a motion
alignment module aimed at improving temporal structural coherence across
multiple time steps. To our knowledge, this is the first diffusion-based model
aimed at predicting protein trajectories across multiple time steps
simultaneously. Validation on benchmark datasets demonstrates that our model
exhibits high accuracy in predicting dynamic 3D structures of proteins
containing up to 256 amino acids over 32 time steps, effectively capturing both
local flexibility in stable states and significant conformational changes.


### CODE: Confident Ordinary Differential Editing
**Authors**: Bastien van Delft, Tommaso Martorella, Alexandre Alahi

**Published Date**: 2024-08-22

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-22

**PDF Url**: [2408.12418v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.12418v1)

**Abstract**: Conditioning image generation facilitates seamless editing and the creation
of photorealistic images. However, conditioning on noisy or Out-of-Distribution
(OoD) images poses significant challenges, particularly in balancing fidelity
to the input and realism of the output. We introduce Confident Ordinary
Differential Editing (CODE), a novel approach for image synthesis that
effectively handles OoD guidance images. Utilizing a diffusion model as a
generative prior, CODE enhances images through score-based updates along the
probability-flow Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) trajectory. This method
requires no task-specific training, no handcrafted modules, and no assumptions
regarding the corruptions affecting the conditioning image. Our method is
compatible with any diffusion model. Positioned at the intersection of
conditional image generation and blind image restoration, CODE operates in a
fully blind manner, relying solely on a pre-trained generative model. Our
method introduces an alternative approach to blind restoration: instead of
targeting a specific ground truth image based on assumptions about the
underlying corruption, CODE aims to increase the likelihood of the input image
while maintaining fidelity. This results in the most probable in-distribution
image around the input. Our contributions are twofold. First, CODE introduces a
novel editing method based on ODE, providing enhanced control, realism, and
fidelity compared to its SDE-based counterpart. Second, we introduce a
confidence interval-based clipping method, which improves CODE's effectiveness
by allowing it to disregard certain pixels or information, thus enhancing the
restoration process in a blind manner. Experimental results demonstrate CODE's
effectiveness over existing methods, particularly in scenarios involving severe
degradation or OoD inputs.
