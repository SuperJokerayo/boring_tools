**Abstract**: Automated drifting presents a challenge problem for vehicle control,
requiring models and control algorithms that can precisely handle nonlinear,
coupled tire forces at the friction limits. We present a neural network
architecture for predicting front tire lateral force as a drop-in replacement
for physics-based approaches. With a full-scale automated vehicle purpose-built
for the drifting application, we deploy these models in a nonlinear model
predictive controller tuned for tracking a reference drifting trajectory, for
direct comparisons of model performance. The neural network tire model exhibits
significantly improved path tracking performance over the brush tire model in
cases where front-axle braking force is applied, suggesting the neural
network's ability to express previously unmodeled, latent dynamics in the
drifting condition.

**Abstract**: Quantum simulation of lattice gauge theories is a promising tool for the
study of many complicated problems including ones with real-time dynamics. For
gauge theories, however, there is a major challenge in maintaining gauge
invariance during time evolution. Such theories have a full Hilbert space that
is larger than the physical space -- the set of states which are gauge
invariant or equivalently respect the Gauss law. While an exact implementation
of Hamiltonian dynamics starting in the physical Hilbert space will keep the
system in the physical space, various types of errors will inevitably produce
components outside of it. This work proposes a method of suppressing this gauge
drift via the Zeno effect. As in the standard picture of the Zeno effect, our
method relies on frequent projection onto the physical subspace. Additionally,
a technique is discussed to reduce the speed of the gauge drift, which helps to
reduce the required frequency of projections. We demonstrate our method on a
$\mathbb{Z}_2$ gauge theory toy model.

**Abstract**: Understanding the behavior of dense hadronic matter is a central goal in
nuclear physics as it governs the nature and dynamics of astrophysical objects
such as supernovae and neutron stars. Because of the non-perturbative nature of
quantum chromodynamics (QCD), little is known rigorously about hadronic matter
in these extreme conditions. Here, lattice QCD calculations are used to compute
thermodynamic quantities and the equation of state of QCD over a wide range of
isospin chemical potentials. Agreement is seen with chiral perturbation theory
predictions when the chemical potential is small. Comparison to perturbative
QCD calculations at large chemical potential allows for an estimate of the gap
in the superconducting phase, and this quantity is seen to agree with
perturbative determinations. Since the partition function for an isospin
chemical potential, $\mu_I$, bounds the partition function for a baryon
chemical potential $\mu_B=3\mu_I/2$, these calculations also provide rigorous
non-perturbative QCD bounds on the symmetric nuclear matter equation of state
over a wide range of baryon densities for the first time.


### Assessment of models for nonlinear oscillatory flow through a hexagonal sphere pack
**Authors**: Lukas Unglehrt, Michael Manhart

**Published Date**: 2024-02-07

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-18

**PDF Url**: [2402.05320v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.05320v3)

**Abstract**: We review models for unsteady porous media flow in the volume-averaging
framework and we discuss the theoretical relations between the models and the
definition of the model coefficients (and the uncertainty therein). The
different models are compared against direct numerical simulations of
oscillatory flow through a hexagonal sphere pack. The model constants are
determined based on their definition in terms of the Stokes flow, the potential
flow and steady nonlinear flow. Thus, the discrepancies between the model
predictions and the simulation data can be attributed to shortcomings of the
models' parametrisation.
  We found that an extension of the dynamic permeability model of Pride et al.
[Physical Review B 47(9), 1993] with a Forchheimer-type nonlinearity performs
very well for linear flow and for nonlinear flow at low and medium frequencies,
but the Forchheimer term with a coefficient obtained from the steady-state
overpredicts the nonlinear drag at high frequencies. The model reduces to the
unsteady Forchheimer equation with an acceleration coefficient based on the
static viscous tortuosity for low frequencies.
  The unsteady Forchheimer equation with an acceleration coefficient based on
the high frequency limit of the dynamic tortuosity has large errors for linear
flow at medium and high frequencies, but low errors for nonlinear flow at all
frequencies. This is explained by an error cancellation between the inertial
and the nonlinear drag.

**Abstract**: The quantum mechanics formalism introduced new revolutionary concepts
challenging our everyday perceptions. Arguably, quantum entanglement, which
explains correlations that cannot be reproduced classically, is the most
notable of them. Besides its fundamental aspect, entanglement is also a
resource, fueling emergent technologies such as quantum simulators and
computers. The purpose of this chapter is to give a pedagogical introduction to
the topic with a special emphasis on the multipartite scenario, i.e.,
entanglement distributed among many degrees of freedom. Due to the
combinatorial complexity of this setting, particles can interact and become
entangled in a plethora of ways, which we characterize here. We start by
providing the necessary mathematical tools and elementary concepts from
entanglement theory. A part of this chapter will be devoted to classifying and
ordering entangled states. Then, we focus on various entanglement structures
useful in condensed-matter theory such as tensor-network states or symmetric
states useful for quantum-enhanced sensing. Finally, we discuss
state-of-the-art methods to detect and certify such correlations in
experiments, with some relevant illustrative examples.

**Abstract**: The discovery of van der Waals superconductors in recent years has generated
a lot of excitement for their potentially novel pairing mechanisms. However,
their typical atomic-scale thickness and micrometer-scale lateral dimensions
impose severe challenges to investigations of pairing symmetry by conventional
methods. In this report we demonstrate a new technique that employs
high-quality-factor superconducting resonators to measure the kinetic
inductance -- up to a part per million -- and loss of a van der Waals
superconductor. We analyze the equivalent circuit model to extract the kinetic
inductance, superfluid stiffness, penetration depth, and ratio of imaginary and
real parts of the complex conductivity. We validate the technique by measuring
aluminum and finding excellent agreement in both the zero-temperature
superconducting gap as well as the complex conductivity data when compared with
BCS theory. We then demonstrate the utility of the technique by measuring the
kinetic inductance of multi-layered niobium diselenide and discuss the limits
to the accuracy of our technique when the transition temperature of the sample,
NbSe$_2$ at 7.06 K, approaches our Nb probe resonator at 8.59 K. Our method
will be useful for practitioners in the growing fields of superconducting
physics, materials science, and quantum sensing, as a means of characterizing
superconducting circuit components and studying pairing mechanisms of the novel
superconducting states which arise in layered 2D materials and
heterostructures.

**Abstract**: Supported metal nanoparticle (NP) catalysts are vital for the sustainable
production of chemicals, but their design and implementation are limited by the
ability to identify and characterize their structures and atomic sites that are
correlated with high catalytic activity. Identification of these ''active
sites'' has relied heavily on extrapolation to supported NP systems from
investigation of idealized surfaces, experimentally using single crystals or
supported NPs which are always modelled computationally using slab or regular
polyhedra models. However, the ability of these methods to predict catalytic
activity remains qualitative at best, as the structure of metal NPs in reactive
environments has only been speculated from indirect experimental observations,
or otherwise remains wholly unknown. Here, by circumventing these limitations
for highly accurate simulation methods, we provide direct atomistic insight
into the dynamic restructuring of metal NPs by combining in situ spectroscopy
with molecular dynamics simulations powered by a machine learned force field.
We find that in reactive environments, NP surfaces evolve to a state with
poorly defined atomic order, while the core of the NP may remain bulk-like.
These insights prove that long-standing conceptual models based on idealized
faceting for small metal NP systems are not representative of real systems
under exposure to reactive environments. We show that the resultant structure
can be elucidated by combining advanced spectroscopy and computational tools.
This discovery exemplifies that to enable faithful quantitative predictions of
catalyst function and stability, we must move beyond idealized-facet
experimental and theoretical models and instead employ systems which include
realistic surface structures that respond to relevant physical and chemical
conditions.


### Exploration to early universe by Josephson Junction Switching Current Detector
**Authors**: Dan Kondo

**Published Date**: 2024-07-18

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-18

**PDF Url**: [2407.13630v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13630v1)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose a method to probe a Stochastic Gravitational Wave
Background (SGWB) with Josephson Junction Switching Current Detector (JJSCD).
The sensitivity for the shear can reach $h\simeq 10^{-19}$ realistically,
$10^{-21}$ in the near future, $10^{-24}$ optimistically. If we utilize the
enhancement factor from the ratio of the frequency, it is possible to reach
further below the Big Bang Nucleosynthesis (BBN) bound. It will be interesting
if we can access the region to discover a footprint of new physics.


### Certifying ground-state properties of quantum many-body systems
**Authors**: Jie Wang, Jacopo Surace, Irénée Frérot, Benoît Legat, Marc-Olivier Renou, Victor Magron, Antonio Acín

**Published Date**: 2023-10-09

**PDF Url**: [2310.05844v5](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.05844v5)

**Abstract**: A ubiquitous problem in quantum physics is to understand the ground-state
properties of many-body systems. Confronted with the fact that exact
diagonalisation quickly becomes impossible when increasing the system size,
variational approaches are typically employed as a scalable alternative: energy
is minimised over a subset of all possible states and then different physical
quantities are computed over the solution state. Despite remarkable success,
rigorously speaking, all what variational methods offer are upper bounds on the
ground-state energy. On the other hand, so-called relaxations of the
ground-state problem based on semidefinite programming represent a
complementary approach, providing lower bounds to the ground-state energy.
However, in their current implementation, neither variational nor relaxation
methods offer provable bound on other observables in the ground state beyond
the energy. In this work, we show that the combination of the two classes of
approaches can be used to derive certifiable bounds on the value of any
observable in the ground state, such as correlation functions of arbitrary
order, structure factors, or order parameters. We illustrate the power of this
approach in paradigmatic examples of 1D and 2D spin-one-half Heisenberg models.
To improve the scalability of the method, we exploit the symmetries and
sparsity of the considered systems to reach sizes of hundreds of particles at
much higher precision than previous works. Our analysis therefore shows how to
obtain certifiable bounds on many-body ground-state properties beyond energy in
a scalable way.


### On the collider-testability of the type-I seesaw model with 3 right-handed neutrinos
**Authors**: Marco Drewes, Yannis Georis, Juraj Klarić, Antony Wendels

**PDF Url**: [2407.13620v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13620v1)

**Abstract**: If any heavy neutral leptons are discovered in accelerator-based experiments,
key questions will involve their possible connection to neutrino masses or
leptogenesis. Working in a renormalisable extension of the Standard Model by
three right-handed neutrinos, we address the question of how much information
about the fundamental model parameters can be obtained by measuring the
branching ratios in the decays of the heavy neutral leptons into individual SM
generations. We find that, provided that these branching ratios could be
measured with arbitrary precision, they would be sufficient to pin down all 18
parameters of the model when supplemented with light neutrino oscillation data.
When considering a finite statistical uncertainty comparable to that which can
be achieved by future lepton colliders in the mass range of tens of GeV, some
parameter degeneracies remain, but measurements would still provide powerful
consistency checks of the model. In the sub-GeV range similar sensitivities can
be expected for SHiP and DUNE. This shows the potential of these experiments to
not only discover heavy neutral leptons, but play an important role in
understanding their role in particle physics and cosmology.


## Diffusion
### Understanding Reinforcement Learning-Based Fine-Tuning of Diffusion Models: A Tutorial and Review
**Authors**: Masatoshi Uehara, Yulai Zhao, Tommaso Biancalani, Sergey Levine

**Published Date**: 2024-07-18

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-18

**PDF Url**: [2407.13734v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13734v1)

**Abstract**: This tutorial provides a comprehensive survey of methods for fine-tuning
diffusion models to optimize downstream reward functions. While diffusion
models are widely known to provide excellent generative modeling capability,
practical applications in domains such as biology require generating samples
that maximize some desired metric (e.g., translation efficiency in RNA, docking
score in molecules, stability in protein). In these cases, the diffusion model
can be optimized not only to generate realistic samples but also to explicitly
maximize the measure of interest. Such methods are based on concepts from
reinforcement learning (RL). We explain the application of various RL
algorithms, including PPO, differentiable optimization, reward-weighted MLE,
value-weighted sampling, and path consistency learning, tailored specifically
for fine-tuning diffusion models. We aim to explore fundamental aspects such as
the strengths and limitations of different RL-based fine-tuning algorithms
across various scenarios, the benefits of RL-based fine-tuning compared to
non-RL-based approaches, and the formal objectives of RL-based fine-tuning
(target distributions). Additionally, we aim to examine their connections with
related topics such as classifier guidance, Gflownets, flow-based diffusion
models, path integral control theory, and sampling from unnormalized
distributions such as MCMC. The code of this tutorial is available at

### An Intrinsic Vector Heat Network

**Abstract**: Vector fields are widely used to represent and model flows for many science
and engineering applications. This paper introduces a novel neural network
architecture for learning tangent vector fields that are intrinsically defined
on manifold surfaces embedded in 3D. Previous approaches to learning vector
fields on surfaces treat vectors as multi-dimensional scalar fields, using
traditional scalar-valued architectures to process channels individually, thus
fail to preserve fundamental intrinsic properties of the vector field. The core
idea of this work is to introduce a trainable vector heat diffusion module to
spatially propagate vector-valued feature data across the surface, which we
incorporate into our proposed architecture that consists of vector-valued
neurons. Our architecture is invariant to rigid motion of the input, isometric
deformation, and choice of local tangent bases, and is robust to
discretizations of the surface. We evaluate our Vector Heat Network on triangle
meshes, and empirically validate its invariant properties. We also demonstrate
the effectiveness of our method on the useful industrial application of
quadrilateral mesh generation.


### Training-free Composite Scene Generation for Layout-to-Image Synthesis
**Authors**: Jiaqi Liu, Tao Huang, Chang Xu

**Published Date**: 2024-07-18

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-18

**PDF Url**: [2407.13609v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13609v1)

**Abstract**: Recent breakthroughs in text-to-image diffusion models have significantly
advanced the generation of high-fidelity, photo-realistic images from textual
descriptions. Yet, these models often struggle with interpreting spatial
arrangements from text, hindering their ability to produce images with precise
spatial configurations. To bridge this gap, layout-to-image generation has
emerged as a promising direction. However, training-based approaches are
limited by the need for extensively annotated datasets, leading to high data
acquisition costs and a constrained conceptual scope. Conversely, training-free
methods face challenges in accurately locating and generating semantically
similar objects within complex compositions. This paper introduces a novel
training-free approach designed to overcome adversarial semantic intersections
during the diffusion conditioning phase. By refining intra-token loss with
selective sampling and enhancing the diffusion process with attention
redistribution, we propose two innovative constraints: 1) an inter-token
constraint that resolves token conflicts to ensure accurate concept synthesis;
and 2) a self-attention constraint that improves pixel-to-pixel relationships.
Our evaluations confirm the effectiveness of leveraging layout information for
guiding the diffusion process, generating content-rich images with enhanced
fidelity and complexity. Code is available at

### EnergyDiff: Universal Time-Series Energy Data Generation using Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Nan Lin, Peter Palensky, Pedro P. Vergara

**Published Date**: 2024-07-18

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-18

**PDF Url**: [2407.13538v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13538v1)

**Abstract**: High-resolution time series data are crucial for operation and planning in
energy systems such as electrical power systems and heating systems. However,
due to data collection costs and privacy concerns, such data is often
unavailable or insufficient for downstream tasks. Data synthesis is a potential
solution for this data scarcity. With the recent development of generative AI,
we propose EnergyDiff, a universal data generation framework for energy time
series data. EnergyDiff builds on state-of-the-art denoising diffusion
probabilistic models, utilizing a proposed denoising network dedicated to
high-resolution time series data and introducing a novel Marginal Calibration
technique. Our extensive experimental results demonstrate that EnergyDiff
achieves significant improvement in capturing temporal dependencies and
marginal distributions compared to baselines, particularly at the 1-minute
resolution. Additionally, EnergyDiff consistently generates high-quality time
series data across diverse energy domains, time resolutions, and at both
customer and transformer levels with reduced computational need.


### Fundamental Visual Navigation Algorithms: Indirect Sequential, Biased Diffusive, & Direct Pathing

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-18

**PDF Url**: [2407.13535v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.13535v1)

**Abstract**: Effective foraging in a predictable local environment requires coordinating
movement with observable spatial context - in a word, navigation. Distinct from
search, navigating to specific areas known to be valuable entails its own
particularities. How space is understood through vision and parsed for
navigation is often examined experimentally, with limited ability to manipulate
sensory inputs and probe into the algorithmic level of decision-making.
  As a generalizable, minimal alternative to empirical means, we evolve and
study embodied neural networks to explore information processing algorithms an
organism may use for visual spatial navigation. Surprisingly, three distinct
classes of algorithms emerged, each with its own set of rules and tradeoffs,
and each appear to be highly relevant to observable biological navigation
behaviors.
