**Abstract**: Strongly correlated materials are known to display qualitatively distinct
emergent behaviors at low energy. Conveniently, the superposition principle of
quantum mechanics ensures that, upon absorbing quantum fluctuation, these rich
low-energy behaviors can always be effectively described by dressed particles
with fully quantized charge, spin, and orbitals structure. Such a powerful and
simple description is, however, difficult to access through density functional
theory (DFT) calculations, since in terms of bare particles the quantum
fluctuation would heavily smear the quantized quantities. To address this
difficulty, we propose an `interaction annealing' approach to decipher the
dominant valence and orbital structure by suppressing the charge fluctuation
through enhancing ionic charging energy. Applying this approach to
ferroelectric semi-metal WTe${_2}$ as a demonstration, we identify a dominant
ferro-orbital ordered structure with W ion in a $d^2$ spin-0 configuration. The
proposed approach is straightforward to implement in standard DFT calculations
to grant additional access to essential low-energy physics.

**Abstract**: Employing physically-consistent numerical methods is an important step
towards attaining robust and accurate numerical simulations. When addressing
compressible flows, in addition to preserving kinetic energy at a discrete
level, as done in the incompressible case, additional properties are sought
after, such as the ability to preserve the equilibrium of pressure that can be
found at contact interfaces. This paper investigates the general conditions of
the spatial numerical discretizations to achieve the pressure equilibrium
preserving property (PEP). Schemes from the literature are analyzed in this
respect, and procedures to impart the PEP property to existing discretizations
are proposed. Additionally, new PEP numerical schemes are introduced through
minor modifications of classical ones. Numerical tests confirmed the theory
hereby presented and showed that the modifications, beyond the enforcement of
the PEP property, have a generally positive impact on the performances of the
original schemes.

**PDF Url**: [2405.05427v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05427v2)

**Abstract**: The chiral magnetic effect (CME) is a collective quantum phenomenon that
arises from the interplay between gauge field topology and fermion chiral
anomaly, encompassing a wide range of physical systems from semimetals to
quark-gluon plasma. This review, with a focus on CME and related effects in
heavy ion collisions, aims to provide an introductory discussion on its
conceptual foundation and measurement methodology, a timely update on the
present status in terms of experimental findings and theoretical progress, as
well as an outlook into the open problems and future developments.

**Abstract**: In H-mode tokamak plasmas, the plasma is sometimes ejected beyond the edge
transport barrier. These events are known as edge localized modes (ELMs). ELMs
cause a loss of energy and damage the vessel walls. Understanding the physics
of ELMs and by extension, how to detect and mitigate them, is an important
challenge. In this paper, we focus on two diagnostic methods $\unicode{x2013}$
D-alpha spectroscopy and Doppler backscattering (DBS). The former detects ELMs
by measuring Balmer alpha emission while the latter uses microwave radiation to
probe the plasma. DBS has the advantage of having higher temporal resolution
and robustness to damage. These advantages of DBS diagnostics may be beneficial
for future operational tokamaks and thus data processing techniques for DBS
should be developed in preparation. In sight of this, we explore the training
of neural networks to detect ELMs from DBS data, using D-alpha data as the
ground truth. With shots found in the DIII-D database, the model is trained to
classify each time step based on the occurrence of an ELM event. The results
are promising. When tested on shots similar to those used for training, the
model is capable of consistently achieving a high f1-score of 0.93. This score
is a performance metric for imbalanced datasets that ranges between 0 and 1. We
evaluate the performance of our neural network on a variety of ELMs
$\unicode{x2013}$ grasssy, suppressed, and wide pedestal $\unicode{x2013}$
finding broad applicability. Beyond ELMs, our work demonstrates the wider
feasibility of applying neural networks to data from DBS diagnostics.


### Null Infinity and Horizons: A New Approach to Fluxes and Charges
**Authors**: Abhay Ashtekar, Simone Speziale

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-03

**PDF Url**: [2407.03254v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03254v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce a Hamiltonian framework tailored to degrees of freedom (DOF) of
field theories that reside in suitable 3-dimensional open regions, and then
apply it to the gravitational DOF of general relativity. Specifically, these
DOF now refer to open regions of null infinity, and of black hole (and
cosmological) horizons representing equilibrium situations. At null infinity
the new Hamiltonian framework yields the well-known BMS fluxes and charges. By
contrast, all fluxes vanish identically at black hole (and cosmological)
horizons just as one would physically expect. In a companion paper we showed
that, somewhat surprisingly, the geometry and symmetries of these two physical
configurations descend from a common framework. This paper reinforces that
theme: Very different physics emerges in the two cases from a common
Hamiltonian framework because of the difference in the nature of degrees of
freedom. Finally, we compare and contrast this Hamiltonian approach with those
available in the literature.

**Abstract**: The structures and properties of organic-inorganic perovskites are influenced
by the hydrogen bonding between the organic cations and the inorganic
octahedral networks. This study explores the dynamics of hydrogen bonds in
CH$_3$NH$_3$PbBr$_3$ across a temperature range from 70 K to 350 K, using
molecular dynamics simulations with machine-learning force fields. The results
indicate that the lifetime of hydrogen bonds decreases with increasing
temperature from 7.6 ps (70 K) to 0.16 ps (350 K), exhibiting Arrhenius-type
behaviour. The geometric conditions for hydrogen bonding, which include bond
lengths and angles, maintain consistency across the full temperature range. The
relevance of hydrogen bonds for the vibrational states of the material is also
evidenced through a detailed analysis of the vibrational power spectra,
demonstrating their significant effect on the physical properties for this
class of perovskites.


### Quantum Curved Tetrahedron, Quantum Group Intertwiner Space, and Coherent States
**Authors**: Chen-Hung Hsiao, Qiaoyin Pan

**Published Date**: 2024-07-03

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-03

**PDF Url**: [2407.03242v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03242v1)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we construct the phase space of a constantly curved
tetrahedron with fixed triangle areas in terms of a pair of Darboux coordinates
called the length and twist coordinates, which are in analogy to the
Fenchel-Nielsen coordinates for flat connections, and their quantization. The
curvature is identified to the value of the cosmological constant, either
positive or negative. The physical Hilbert space is given by the
$\mathcal{U}_q(\mathfrak{su}(2))$ intertwiner space. We show that the quantum
trace of quantum monodromies, defining the quantum length operators, form a
fusion algebra and describe their representation theory. We also construct the
coherent states in the physical Hilbert space labeled by the length and twist
coordinates. These coherent states describe quantum curved tetrahedra and peak
at points of the tetrahedron phase space. This works is closely related to 3+1
dimensional Loop Quantum Gravity with a non-vanishing cosmological constant.
The coherent states constructed herein serve as good candidates for the
application to the spinfoam model with a cosmological constant.

**Abstract**: Cosmological fluctuations retain a memory of the physics that generated them
in their spatial correlations. The strength of correlations varies smoothly as
a function of external kinematics, which is encoded in differential equations
satisfied by cosmological correlation functions. In this work, we provide a
broader perspective on the origin and structure of these differential
equations. As a concrete example, we study conformally coupled scalar fields in
a power-law cosmology. The wavefunction coefficients in this model have
integral representations, with the integrands being the product of the
corresponding flat-space results and "twist factors" that depend on the
cosmological evolution. These integrals are part of a finite-dimensional basis
of master integrals, which satisfy a system of first-order differential
equations. We develop a formalism to derive these differential equations for
arbitrary tree graphs. The results can be represented in graphical form by
associating the singularities of the differential equations with a set of graph
tubings. Upon differentiation, these tubings grow in a local and predictive
fashion. In fact, a few remarkably simple rules allow us to predict -- by hand
-- the equations for all tree graphs. While the rules of this "kinematic flow"
are defined purely in terms of data on the boundary of the spacetime, they
reflect the physics of bulk time evolution. We also study the analogous
structures in ${\rm tr}\,\phi^3$ theory, and see some glimpses of hidden
structure in the sum over planar graphs. This suggests that there is an
autonomous combinatorial or geometric construction from which cosmological
correlations, and the associated spacetime, emerge.


### Searching for New Fundamental Interactions via Isotopic Shifts in Molecular Lattice Clocks

**PDF Url**: [2403.07097v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.07097v2)

**Abstract**: Precision measurements with ultracold atoms and molecules are primed to probe
beyond-the-Standard Model physics. Isotopologues of homonuclear molecules are a
natural testbed for new Yukawa-type mass-dependent forces at nanometer scales,
complementing existing mesoscopic-body and neutron scattering experiments. Here
we propose using isotopic shift measurements in molecular lattice clocks to
constrain these new interactions from new massive scalar particles in keV$/c^2$
range: the new interaction would impart an extra isotopic shift to molecular
levels on top of one predicted by the Standard Model. For the strontium dimer,
a Hz-level agreement between experiment and theory could constrain the coupling
of the new particles to hadrons by up to an order-of-magnitude over the most
stringent existing experiments.

**Abstract**: Frequency conversion is a widely realized physical process in nonlinear
systems of optics and electronics. As an emerging nonlinear platform,
spintronic devices have the potential to achieve stronger frequency conversion.
Here, we demonstrated a microwave frequency conversion method in a hybrid
quantum system, integrating nitrogen-vacancy centers in diamond with magnetic
thin film CoFeB. We achieve a conversion bandwidth ranging from 0.1 to 12GHz,
presenting an up to $\mathrm{25^{th}}$ order frequency conversion and further
display the application of this method for frequency detection and qubits
coherent control. Distinct from traditional frequency conversion techniques
based on nonlinear electric response, our approach employs nonlinear magnetic
response in spintronic devices. The nonlinearity, originating from the symmetry
breaking such as domain walls in magnetic films, presents that our method can
be adapted to hybrid systems of other spintronic devices and spin qubits,
expanding the application scope of spintronic devices and providing a promising
on-chip platform for coupling quantum systems.

**Authors**: Yilun Xu, Gabriele Corso, Tommi Jaakkola, Arash Vahdat, Karsten Kreis

**Published Date**: 2024-07-03

**PDF Url**: [2407.03300v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03300v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models (DMs) have revolutionized generative learning. They utilize
a diffusion process to encode data into a simple Gaussian distribution.
However, encoding a complex, potentially multimodal data distribution into a
single continuous Gaussian distribution arguably represents an unnecessarily
challenging learning problem. We propose Discrete-Continuous Latent Variable
Diffusion Models (DisCo-Diff) to simplify this task by introducing
complementary discrete latent variables. We augment DMs with learnable discrete
latents, inferred with an encoder, and train DM and encoder end-to-end.
DisCo-Diff does not rely on pre-trained networks, making the framework
universally applicable. The discrete latents significantly simplify learning
the DM's complex noise-to-data mapping by reducing the curvature of the DM's
generative ODE. An additional autoregressive transformer models the
distribution of the discrete latents, a simple step because DisCo-Diff requires
only few discrete variables with small codebooks. We validate DisCo-Diff on toy
data, several image synthesis tasks as well as molecular docking, and find that
introducing discrete latents consistently improves model performance. For
example, DisCo-Diff achieves state-of-the-art FID scores on class-conditioned
ImageNet-64/128 datasets with ODE sampler.

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have emerged as the de facto choice for generating visual
signals. However, training a single model to predict noise across various
levels poses significant challenges, necessitating numerous iterations and
incurring significant computational costs. Various approaches, such as loss
weighting strategy design and architectural refinements, have been introduced
to expedite convergence. In this study, we propose a novel approach to design
the noise schedule for enhancing the training of diffusion models. Our key
insight is that the importance sampling of the logarithm of the Signal-to-Noise
ratio (logSNR), theoretically equivalent to a modified noise schedule, is
particularly beneficial for training efficiency when increasing the sample
frequency around $\log \text{SNR}=0$. We empirically demonstrate the
superiority of our noise schedule over the standard cosine schedule.
Furthermore, we highlight the advantages of our noise schedule design on the
ImageNet benchmark, showing that the designed schedule consistently benefits
different prediction targets.

**Authors**: Jianuo Huang

**Published Date**: 2024-06-30

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-03

**PDF Url**: [2407.00741v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.00741v2)

**Abstract**: In recent advancements in Multi-agent Reinforcement Learning (MARL), its
application has extended to various safety-critical scenarios. However, most
methods focus on online learning, which presents substantial risks when
deployed in real-world settings. Addressing this challenge, we introduce an
innovative framework integrating diffusion models within the MARL paradigm.
This approach notably enhances the safety of actions taken by multiple agents
through risk mitigation while modeling coordinated action. Our framework is
grounded in the Centralized Training with Decentralized Execution (CTDE)
architecture, augmented by a Diffusion Model for prediction trajectory
generation. Additionally, we incorporate a specialized algorithm to further
ensure operational safety. We evaluate our model against baselines on the DSRL
benchmark. Experiment results demonstrate that our model not only adheres to
stringent safety constraints but also achieves superior performance compared to
existing methodologies. This underscores the potential of our approach in
advancing the safety and efficacy of MARL in real-world applications.


### Spatio-Temporal Adaptive Diffusion Models for EEG Super-Resolution in Epilepsy Diagnosis
**Authors**: Tong Zhou, Shuqiang Wang

**PDF Url**: [2407.03089v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.03089v1)

**Abstract**: Electroencephalogram (EEG) technology, particularly high-density EEG (HD EEG)
devices, is widely used in fields such as neuroscience. HD EEG devices improve
the spatial resolution of EEG by placing more electrodes on the scalp, meeting
the requirements of clinical diagnostic applications such as epilepsy focus
localization. However, this technique faces challenges such as high acquisition
costs and limited usage scenarios. In this paper, spatio-temporal adaptive
diffusion models (STADMs) are proposed to pioneer the use of diffusion models
for achieving spatial SR reconstruction from low-resolution (LR, 64 channels or
fewer) EEG to high-resolution (HR, 256 channels) EEG. Specifically, a
spatio-temporal condition module is designed to extract the spatio-temporal
features of LR EEG, which then serve as conditional inputs to guide the reverse
denoising process of diffusion models. Additionally, a multi-scale Transformer
denoising module is constructed to leverage multi-scale convolution blocks and
cross-attention-based diffusion Transformer blocks for conditional guidance to
generate subject-adaptive SR EEG. Experimental results demonstrate that the
proposed method effectively enhances the spatial resolution of LR EEG and
quantitatively outperforms existing methods. Furthermore, STADMs demonstrate
their value by applying synthetic SR EEG to classification and source
localization tasks of epilepsy patients, indicating their potential to
significantly improve the spatial resolution of LR EEG.

**Abstract**: Generating diverse samples under hard constraints is a core challenge in many
areas. With this work we aim to provide an integrative view and framework to
combine methods from the fields of MCMC, constrained optimization, as well as
robotics, and gain insights in their strengths from empirical evaluations. We
propose NLP Sampling as a general problem formulation, propose a family of
restarting two-phase methods as a framework to integrated methods from across
the fields, and evaluate them on analytical and robotic manipulation planning
problems. Complementary to this, we provide several conceptual discussions,
e.g. on the role of Lagrange parameters, global sampling, and the idea of a
Diffused NLP and a corresponding model-based denoising sampler.
