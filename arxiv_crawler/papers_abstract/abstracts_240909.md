**Abstract**: Trapped ions offer long coherence times and high fidelity, programmable
quantum operations, making them a promising platform for quantum simulation of
condensed matter systems, quantum dynamics, and problems related to high-energy
physics. We review selected developments in trapped-ion qubits and
architectures and discuss quantum simulation applications that utilize these
emerging capabilities. This review emphasizes developments in digital
(gate-based) quantum simulations that exploit trapped-ion hardware
capabilities, such as flexible qubit connectivity, selective mid-circuit
measurement, and classical feedback, to simulate models with long-range
interactions, explore non-unitary dynamics, compress simulations of states with
limited entanglement, and reduce the circuit depths required to prepare or
simulate long-range entangled states.

**Abstract**: Gravitational waves are a unique probe of the early Universe, as the Universe
is transparent to gravitational radiation right back to the end of inflation.
In this article, we summarise detection prospects and the wide scope of
primordial events that could lead to a detectable stochastic gravitational wave
background. Any such background would shed light on what lies beyond the
Standard Model, sometimes at remarkably high scales. We overview the range of
strategies for detecting a stochastic gravitational wave background before
delving deep into three major primordial events that can source such a
background. Finally, we summarize the landscape of other sources of primordial
backgrounds.


### Stories in the two-state vector formalism

**Abstract**: The two-state vector formalism of quantum mechanics is a time-symmetrized
approach to standard quantum theory. In our work, we aim to establish rigorous
foundations for the future investigation within this formalism. We introduce
the concept of a story - a compatible pair consisting of a two-state vector and
an ideal measurement. Using this concept, we examine the structure of the space
comprising all two-state vectors. We conclude that some pairs of two-state
vectors or their statistical mixtures cannot be physically distinguished. In
particular, we demonstrate that not every non-separable two-state vector is
distinguishable from a statistical mixture of separable two-state vectors. This
leads us to formulate the definition of a strictly non-separable two-state
vector as a genuine manifestation of entanglement between the past and the
future.


### Suppressing Gauge Drift in Quantum Simulations with Gauge Transformations

**PDF Url**: [2409.04395v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04395v1)

**Abstract**: The simulation of quantum lattice gauge theories faces the major challenge of
maintaining gauge invariance, as various errors in the simulation push the
state of the system out of the physical subspace of the system's exponentially
larger Hilbert space. This paper outlines a method, based off of previous work,
that uses gauge transformations in two ways. Firstly, the method exploits the
Zeno effect by conducting frequent projections to suppress gauge drift. These
projections utilize local gauge transformations to destructively interfere
unphysical amplitudes via coupling to an ancillary qubit while the physical
amplitudes are left untouched, up to a less than unity normalization factor.
Secondly, gauge transformations are conducted throughout the time evolution of
the system to hamper the speed of gauge drift. This paper demonstrates this
method on a pure 1D SU$(2)$ toy model.

**Abstract**: Quasiperiodic systems extend the concept of the Anderson transition to
quasi-random and low-dimensional realms and have garnered widespread attention.
Here, we propose the asymptotic quasiperiodic two-dimensional systems
characterized by a sequence of rational magnetic fluxes, which have an
irrational limit, and predict exotic universal wave-packet dynamics and
transport phenomena associated with the asymptotic quasiperiodicity (AQP). The
predictions unveil a class of multiple metal-insulator transitions driven by a
novel interplay effect between AQP, relaxation, and finite temperature, which
further reveals a unified and profound mechanism. Specifically, all the
transport phenomena, including the wave-packet dynamics, the bulk and edge
transport, are unified in the universal scaling laws unveiled in the asymptotic
quasiperiodic regime, which demonstrate a nontrivial asymptotic connection to
quantum phases in the quasiperiodic limit. Our work enriches the universal
quantum transport phenomena, adds to the basic mechanisms underlying
metal-insulator transitions, and opens up an avenue to study the exotic
transport physics with AQP in high dimensions.


### Future singularity in an anisotropic universe
**Authors**: Taishi Katsuragawa, Shin'ichi Nojiri, Sergei D. Odintsov

**Published Date**: 2024-06-26

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-06

**PDF Url**: [2406.18368v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.18368v2)

**Abstract**: We investigate future singularities originating from the anisotropy in the
Universe. We formulate a new class of singularities in the homogeneous and
anisotropic universe, comparing them with the known singularities in the
homogeneous and isotropic universe. We also discuss the physical consequences
of the new singularities. Moreover, we develop a novel reconstruction method
for the anisotropic universe by introducing four scalar fields to reconstruct
cosmological models in which future singularities appear. We present an
explicit example where the anisotropy may grow in the future up to singularity.


### Kohn-Sham inversion with mathematical guarantees
**Authors**: Michael F. Herbst, Vebj√∏rn H. Bakkestuen, Andre Laestadius

**Published Date**: 2024-09-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-06

**PDF Url**: [2409.04372v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04372v1)

**Abstract**: We use an exact Moreau-Yosida regularized formulation to obtain the
exchange-correlation potential for periodic systems. We reveal a profound
connection between rigorous mathematical principles and efficient numerical
implementation, which marks the first computation of a Moreau-Yosida-based
inversion for physical systems. We develop a mathematically rigorous inversion
algorithm including error bounds that are verified numerically in bulk silicon.
This unlocks a new pathway to analyze Kohn-Sham inversion methods, which we
expect in turn to foster mathematical approaches for developing approximate
functionals.


### A high-order procedure for computing globally optimal Wannier functions in one-dimensional crystalline insulators
**Authors**: Abinand Gopal, Hanwen Zhang

**Published Date**: 2024-09-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-06

**PDF Url**: [2409.04369v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04369v1)

**Abstract**: A standard task in solid state physics and quantum chemistry is the
computation of localized molecular orbits known as Wannier functions. In this
manuscript, we propose a new procedure for computing Wannier functions in
one-dimensional crystalline materials. Our approach proceeds by first
performing parallel transport of the Bloch functions using numerical
integration. Then, using novel analysis, we show that a simple correction can
be analytically computed that yields the optimally localized Wannier function.
The resulting scheme is robust and capable of achieving high-order accuracy. We
illustrate this in a number of numerical experiments.


### The decoupling of moduli about the standard embedding

**PDF Url**: [2409.04350v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04350v1)

**Abstract**: We study the cohomology of an elliptic differential complex arising from the
infinitesimal moduli of heterotic string theory. We compute these cohomology
groups at the standard embedding, and show that they decompose into a direct
sum of cohomologies. While this is often assumed in the literature, it had not
been explicitly demonstrated. Given a stable gauge bundle over a complex
threefold with trivial canonical bundle and no holomorphic vector fields, we
also show that the Euler characteristic of this differential complex is zero.
This points towards a perfect obstruction theory for the heterotic moduli
problem, at least for the most physically relevant compactifications.

**PDF Url**: [2307.14325v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.14325v3)

**Abstract**: Simulating physical systems on quantum devices is one of the most promising
applications of quantum technology. Current quantum approaches to simulating
open quantum systems are still practically challenging on NISQ-era devices,
because they typically require ancilla qubits and extensive controlled
sequences. In this work, we propose a hybrid quantum-classical approach for
simulating a class of open system dynamics called random-unitary channels.
These channels naturally decompose into a series of convex unitary evolutions,
which can then be efficiently sampled and run as independent circuits. The
method does not require deep ancilla frameworks and thus can be implemented
with lower noise costs. We implement simulations of open quantum systems up to
dozens of qubits and with large channel ranks.

**Abstract**: VILA-U is a Unified foundation model that integrates Video, Image, Language
understanding and generation. Traditional visual language models (VLMs) use
separate modules for understanding and generating visual content, which can
lead to misalignment and increased complexity. In contrast, VILA-U employs a
single autoregressive next-token prediction framework for both tasks,
eliminating the need for additional components like diffusion models. This
approach not only simplifies the model but also achieves near state-of-the-art
performance in visual language understanding and generation. The success of
VILA-U is attributed to two main factors: the unified vision tower that aligns
discrete visual tokens with textual inputs during pretraining, which enhances
visual perception, and autoregressive image generation can achieve similar
quality as diffusion models with high-quality dataset. This allows VILA-U to
perform comparably to more complex models using a fully token-based
autoregressive framework.


### GST: Precise 3D Human Body from a Single Image with Gaussian Splatting Transformers
**Authors**: Lorenza Prospero, Abdullah Hamdi, Joao F. Henriques, Christian Rupprecht

**Published Date**: 2024-09-06

**PDF Url**: [2409.04196v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.04196v1)

**Abstract**: Reconstructing realistic 3D human models from monocular images has
significant applications in creative industries, human-computer interfaces, and
healthcare. We base our work on 3D Gaussian Splatting (3DGS), a scene
representation composed of a mixture of Gaussians. Predicting such mixtures for
a human from a single input image is challenging, as it is a non-uniform
density (with a many-to-one relationship with input pixels) with strict
physical constraints. At the same time, it needs to be flexible to accommodate
a variety of clothes and poses. Our key observation is that the vertices of
standardized human meshes (such as SMPL) can provide an adequate density and
approximate initial position for Gaussians. We can then train a transformer
model to jointly predict comparatively small adjustments to these positions, as
well as the other Gaussians' attributes and the SMPL parameters. We show
empirically that this combination (using only multi-view supervision) can
achieve fast inference of 3D human models from a single image without test-time
optimization, expensive diffusion models, or 3D points supervision. We also
show that it can improve 3D pose estimation by better fitting human models that
account for clothes and other variations. The code is available on the project
website https://abdullahamdi.com/gst/ .


### D4: Text-guided diffusion model-based domain adaptive data augmentation for vineyard shoot detection

**Abstract**: In an agricultural field, plant phenotyping using object detection models is
gaining attention. However, collecting the training data necessary to create
generic and high-precision models is extremely challenging due to the
difficulty of annotation and the diversity of domains. Furthermore, it is
difficult to transfer training data across different crops, and although
machine learning models effective for specific environments, conditions, or
crops have been developed, they cannot be widely applied in actual fields. In
this study, we propose a generative data augmentation method (D4) for vineyard
shoot detection. D4 uses a pre-trained text-guided diffusion model based on a
large number of original images culled from video data collected by unmanned
ground vehicles or other means, and a small number of annotated datasets. The
proposed method generates new annotated images with background information
adapted to the target domain while retaining annotation information necessary
for object detection. In addition, D4 overcomes the lack of training data in
agriculture, including the difficulty of annotation and diversity of domains.
We confirmed that this generative data augmentation method improved the mean
average precision by up to 28.65% for the BBox detection task and the average
precision by up to 13.73% for the keypoint detection task for vineyard shoot
detection. Our generative data augmentation method D4 is expected to
simultaneously solve the cost and domain diversity issues of training data
generation in agriculture and improve the generalization performance of
detection models.


### Goal-Reaching Policy Learning from Non-Expert Observations via Effective Subgoal Guidance
**Authors**: RenMing Huang, Shaochong Liu, Yunqiang Pei, Peng Wang, Guoqing Wang, Yang Yang, Hengtao Shen

**PDF Url**: [2409.03996v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03996v1)

**Abstract**: In this work, we address the challenging problem of long-horizon
goal-reaching policy learning from non-expert, action-free observation data.
Unlike fully labeled expert data, our data is more accessible and avoids the
costly process of action labeling. Additionally, compared to online learning,
which often involves aimless exploration, our data provides useful guidance for
more efficient exploration. To achieve our goal, we propose a novel subgoal
guidance learning strategy. The motivation behind this strategy is that
long-horizon goals offer limited guidance for efficient exploration and
accurate state transition. We develop a diffusion strategy-based high-level
policy to generate reasonable subgoals as waypoints, preferring states that
more easily lead to the final goal. Additionally, we learn state-goal value
functions to encourage efficient subgoal reaching. These two components
naturally integrate into the off-policy actor-critic framework, enabling
efficient goal attainment through informative exploration. We evaluate our
method on complex robotic navigation and manipulation tasks, demonstrating a
significant performance advantage over existing methods. Our ablation study
further shows that our method is robust to observation data with various
corruptions.


### Generating High Dimensional User-Specific Wireless Channels using Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Taekyun Lee, Juseong Park, Hyeji Kim, Jeffrey G. Andrews

**Published Date**: 2024-09-05

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-05

**PDF Url**: [2409.03924v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.03924v1)

**Abstract**: Deep neural network (DNN)-based algorithms are emerging as an important tool
for many physical and MAC layer functions in future wireless communication
systems, including for large multi-antenna channels. However, training such
models typically requires a large dataset of high-dimensional channel
measurements, which are very difficult and expensive to obtain. This paper
introduces a novel method for generating synthetic wireless channel data using
diffusion-based models to produce user-specific channels that accurately
reflect real-world wireless environments. Our approach employs a conditional
denoising diffusion implicit models (cDDIM) framework, effectively capturing
the relationship between user location and multi-antenna channel
characteristics. We generate synthetic high fidelity channel samples using user
positions as conditional inputs, creating larger augmented datasets to overcome
measurement scarcity. The utility of this method is demonstrated through its
efficacy in training various downstream tasks such as channel compression and
beam alignment. Our approach significantly improves over prior methods, such as
adding noise or using generative adversarial networks (GANs), especially in
scenarios with limited initial measurements.
