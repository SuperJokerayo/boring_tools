**Abstract**: During developmental processes such as embryogenesis, how a group of cells
fold into specific structures, is a central question in biology that defines
how living organisms form. Establishing tissue-level morphology critically
relies on how every single cell decides to position itself relative to its
neighboring cells. Despite its importance, it remains a major challenge to
understand and predict the behavior of every cell within the living tissue over
time during such intricate processes. To tackle this question, we propose a
geometric deep learning model that can predict multicellular folding and
embryogenesis, accurately capturing the highly convoluted spatial interactions
among cells. We demonstrate that multicellular data can be represented with
both granular and foam-like physical pictures through a unified graph data
structure, considering both cellular interactions and cell junction networks.
We successfully use our model to achieve two important tasks, interpretable 4-D
morphological sequence alignment, and predicting local cell rearrangements
before they occur at single-cell resolution. Furthermore, using an activation
map and ablation studies, we demonstrate that cell geometries and cell junction
networks together regulate local cell rearrangement which is critical for
embryo morphogenesis. This approach provides a novel paradigm to study
morphogenesis, highlighting a unified data structure and harnessing the power
of geometric deep learning to accurately model the mechanisms and behaviors of
cells during development. It offers a pathway toward creating a unified dynamic
morphological atlas for a variety of developmental processes such as
embryogenesis.

**Abstract**: In the wake of the latest trends of artificial intelligence (AI), there has
been a resurgence of claims and questions about the Turing test and its value,
which are reminiscent of decades of practical "Turing" tests. If AI were
quantum physics, by now several "Schr\"odinger's" cats would have been killed.
It is time for a historical reconstruction of Turing's beautiful thought
experiment. This paper presents a wealth of evidence, including new archival
sources, and gives original answers to several open questions about Turing's
1950 paper, including its relation with early AI.


### Towards Relational Quantum Field Theory

**Abstract**: This paper presents a research program aimed at establishing relational
foundations for relativistic quantum physics. Although the formalism is still
under development, we believe it has matured enough to be shared with the
broader scientific community. Our approach seeks to integrate Quantum Field
Theory on curved backgrounds and scenarios with indefinite causality. Building
on concepts from the operational approach to Quantum Reference Frames, we
extend these ideas significantly. Specifically, we initiate the development of
a general integration theory for operator-valued functions (quantum fields)
with respect to positive operator-valued measures (quantum frames). This allows
us to define quantum frames within the context of arbitrary principal bundles,
replacing group structures. By considering Lorentz principal bundles, we enable
a relational treatment of quantum fields on arbitrarily curved spacetimes. A
form of indefinite spatiotemporality arises from quantum states in the context
of frame bundles. This offers novel perspectives on the problem of reconciling
principles of generally relativistic and quantum physics and on modelling
gravitational fields sourced by quantum systems.

**PDF Url**: [2407.15789v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15789v1)

**Abstract**: In flat-band systems with non-orthogonal compact localized states (CLSs),
onsite perturbations couple neighboring CLSs and generate
exponentially-decaying impurity states, whose degree of localization depends on
lattice parameters. In this work, a diamond chain with constant magnetic flux
per plaquette is decorated with several controlled onsite impurities in a
patterned arrangement, generating an effective system that emerges from the
flat band. The coupling distribution of the effective system is determined by
the relative distance between impurities and the value of the flux, which can
be chosen to engineer a wide variety of models. We employ a staggered
distribution of impurities that effectively produces the well-known
Su-Schrieffer-Heeger model, and show that the topological edge states display
an enhanced robustness to non-chiral disorder due to an averaging effect over
their extension. Finally, we provide a route to implement the system
experimentally using optical waveguides that guide orbital angular momentum
(OAM) modes. This work opens the way for the design of topologically protected
impurity states in other flat-band systems or physical platforms with
non-orthogonal bases.


### Reinterpretation of the Fermi acceleration of cosmic rays in terms of the ballistic surfing acceleration in supernova shocks
**Authors**: Krzysztof Stasiewicz

**Published Date**: 2024-07-22

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-22

**PDF Url**: [2407.15767v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15767v1)

**Abstract**: The applicability of first-order Fermi acceleration in explaining the cosmic
ray spectrum has been reexamined using recent results on shock acceleration
mechanisms from the Multiscale Magnetospheric mission in Earth's bow shock. It
is demonstrated that the Fermi mechanism is a crude approximation of the
ballistic surfing acceleration (BSA) mechanism. While both mechanisms yield
similar expressions for the energy gain of a particle after encountering a
shock once, leading to similar power-law distributions of the cosmic ray energy
spectrum, the Fermi mechanism is found to be inconsistent with fundamental
equations of electrodynamics.
  It is shown that the spectral index of cosmic rays is determined by the
average magnetic field compression rather than the density compression, as in
the Fermi model. It is shown that the knee observed in the spectrum at an
energy of 5x10^{15} eV could correspond to ions with a gyroradius comparable to
the size of shocks in supernova remnants. The BSA mechanism can accurately
reproduce the observed spectral index s = -2.5 below the knee energy, as well
as a steeper spectrum, s = -3, above the knee. The acceleration time up to the
knee, as implied by BSA, is on the order of 300 years.
  First-order Fermi acceleration does not represent a physically valid
mechanism and should be replaced by ballistic surfing acceleration in
applications or models related to quasi-perpendicular shocks in space. It is
noted that BSA, which operates outside of shocks, was previously misattributed
to shock drift acceleration (SDA), which operates within shocks.

**Abstract**: Hands-on experimental experience with quantum systems in the undergraduate
physics curriculum provides students with a deeper understanding of quantum
physics and equips them for the fast-growing quantum science industry. Here we
present an experimental apparatus for performing quantum experiments with
single nitrogen-vacancy (NV) centers in diamond. This apparatus is capable of
basic experiments such as single-qubit initialization, rotation, and
measurement, as well as more advanced experiments investigating
electron-nuclear spin interactions. We describe the basic physics of the NV
center and give examples of potential experiments that can be performed with
this apparatus. We also discuss the options and inherent trade-offs associated
with the choice of diamond samples and hardware. The apparatus described here
enables students to write their own experimental control and data analysis
software from scratch all within a single semester of a typical lab course, as
well as to inspect the optical components and inner workings of the apparatus.
We hope that this work can serve as a standalone resource for any institution
that would like to integrate a quantum instructional lab into its undergraduate
physics and engineering curriculum.


### Non-Abelian Hopf-Euler insulators

**Abstract**: We discuss a class of three-band non-Abelian topological insulators in three
dimensions which carry a single bulk Hopf index protected by spatiotemporal
($\mathcal{PT}$) inversion symmetry. These phases may also host subdimensional
topological invariants given by the Euler characteristic class, resulting in
real Hopf-Euler insulators. Such systems naturally realize helical nodal
structures in the 3D Brillouin zone, providing a physical manifestation of the
linking number described by the Hopf invariant. We show that, by opening a gap
between the valence bands of these systems, one finds a fully-gapped `flag'
phase, which displays a three-band multi-gap Pontryagin invariant. Unlike the
previously reported $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric four-band real Hopf insulator,
which hosts a $\mathbb{Z} \oplus \mathbb{Z}$ invariant, these phases are not
unitarily equivalent to two copies of a complex two-band Hopf insulator. We
show that these uncharted phases can be obtained through dimensional extension
of two-dimensional Euler insulators, and that they support (1) an optical bulk
integrated circular shift effect quantized by the Hopf invariant, (2)
quantum-geometric breathing in the real space Wannier functions, and (3)
surface Euler topology on boundaries. Consequently, our findings pave a way for
novel experimental realizations of real-space quantum-geometry, as these
systems may be directly simulated by utilizing synthethic dimensions in
metamaterials or ultracold atoms.

**Abstract**: The analysis of empirical data through model-free inequalities leads to the
conclusion that violations of Bell-type inequalities by empirical data cannot
have any significance unless one believes that the universe operates according
to the rules of a mathematical model.


### Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments: a discrete data driven approach
**Authors**: Hans De Raedt, Mikhail I. Katsnelson, Manpreet S. Jattana, Vrinda Mehta, Madita Willsch, Dennis Willsch, Kristel Michielsen, Fengping Jin

**PDF Url**: [2304.03962v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2304.03962v4)

**Abstract**: We take the point of view that building a one-way bridge from experimental
data to mathematical models instead of the other way around avoids running into
controversies resulting from attaching meaning to the symbols used in the
latter. In particular, we show that adopting this view offers new perspectives
for constructing mathematical models for and interpreting the results of
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments. We first prove new Bell-type
inequalities constraining the values of the four correlations obtained by
performing Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments under four different
conditions. The proof is ``model-free'' in the sense that it does not refer to
any mathematical model that one imagines to have produced the data. The
constraints only depend on the number of quadruples obtained by reshuffling the
data in the four data sets without changing the values of the correlations.
These new inequalities reduce to model-free versions of the well-known
Bell-type inequalities if the maximum fraction of quadruples is equal to one.
Being model-free, a violation of the latter by experimental data implies that
not all the data in the four data sets can be reshuffled to form quadruples.
Furthermore, being model-free inequalities, a violation of the latter by
experimental data only implies that any mathematical model assumed to produce
this data does not apply. Starting from the data obtained by performing
Einstein-Podolsky-Rosen-Bohm experiments, we construct instead of postulate
mathematical models that describe the main features of these data. The
mathematical framework of plausible reasoning is applied to reproducible and
robust data, yielding without using any concept of quantum theory, the
expression of the correlation for a system of two spin-1/2 objects in the
singlet state. (truncated here)


### Inferring turbulent velocity and temperature fields and their statistics from Lagrangian velocity measurements using physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks
**Authors**: Juan Diego Toscano, Theo Käufer, Martin Maxey, Christian Cierpka, George Em Karniadakis

**Published Date**: 2024-07-22

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-22

**PDF Url**: [2407.15727v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15727v1)

**Abstract**: We propose the Artificial Intelligence Velocimetry-Thermometry (AIVT) method
to infer hidden temperature fields from experimental turbulent velocity data.
This physics-informed machine learning method enables us to infer continuous
temperature fields using only sparse velocity data, hence eliminating the need
for direct temperature measurements. Specifically, AIVT is based on
physics-informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (not neural networks) and is
trained by optimizing a combined loss function that minimizes the residuals of
the velocity data, boundary conditions, and the governing equations. We apply
AIVT to a unique set of experimental volumetric and simultaneous temperature
and velocity data of Rayleigh-B\'enard convection (RBC) that we acquired by
combining Particle Image Thermometry and Lagrangian Particle Tracking. This
allows us to compare AIVT predictions and measurements directly. We demonstrate
that we can reconstruct and infer continuous and instantaneous velocity and
temperature fields from sparse experimental data at a fidelity comparable to
direct numerical simulations (DNS) of turbulence. This, in turn, enables us to
compute important quantities for quantifying turbulence, such as fluctuations,
viscous and thermal dissipation, and QR distribution. This paradigm shift in
processing experimental data using AIVT to infer turbulent fields at DNS-level
fidelity is a promising avenue in breaking the current deadlock of quantitative
understanding of turbulence at high Reynolds numbers, where DNS is
computationally infeasible.


## Diffusion
### Stretching Each Dollar: Diffusion Training from Scratch on a Micro-Budget
**Authors**: Vikash Sehwag, Xianghao Kong, Jingtao Li, Michael Spranger, Lingjuan Lyu

**PDF Url**: [2407.15811v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15811v1)

**Abstract**: As scaling laws in generative AI push performance, they also simultaneously
concentrate the development of these models among actors with large
computational resources. With a focus on text-to-image (T2I) generative models,
we aim to address this bottleneck by demonstrating very low-cost training of
large-scale T2I diffusion transformer models. As the computational cost of
transformers increases with the number of patches in each image, we propose to
randomly mask up to 75% of the image patches during training. We propose a
deferred masking strategy that preprocesses all patches using a patch-mixer
before masking, thus significantly reducing the performance degradation with
masking, making it superior to model downscaling in reducing computational
cost. We also incorporate the latest improvements in transformer architecture,
such as the use of mixture-of-experts layers, to improve performance and
further identify the critical benefit of using synthetic images in micro-budget
training. Finally, using only 37M publicly available real and synthetic images,
we train a 1.16 billion parameter sparse transformer with only \$1,890
economical cost and achieve a 12.7 FID in zero-shot generation on the COCO
dataset. Notably, our model achieves competitive FID and high-quality
generations while incurring 118$\times$ lower cost than stable diffusion models
and 14$\times$ lower cost than the current state-of-the-art approach that costs
\$28,400. We aim to release our end-to-end training pipeline to further
democratize the training of large-scale diffusion models on micro-budgets.


### Diffusion Model Based Resource Allocation Strategy in Ultra-Reliable Wireless Networked Control Systems

**Abstract**: Diffusion models are vastly used in generative AI, leveraging their
capability to capture complex data distributions. However, their potential
remains largely unexplored in the field of resource allocation in wireless
networks. This paper introduces a novel diffusion model-based resource
allocation strategy for Wireless Networked Control Systems (WNCSs) with the
objective of minimizing total power consumption through the optimization of the
sampling period in the control system, and blocklength and packet error
probability in the finite blocklength regime of the communication system. The
problem is first reduced to the optimization of blocklength only based on the
derivation of the optimality conditions. Then, the optimization theory solution
collects a dataset of channel gains and corresponding optimal blocklengths.
Finally, the Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM) uses this collected
dataset to train the resource allocation algorithm that generates optimal
blocklength values conditioned on the channel state information (CSI). Via
extensive simulations, the proposed approach is shown to outperform previously
proposed Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL) based approaches with close to
optimal performance regarding total power consumption. Moreover, an improvement
of up to eighteen-fold in the reduction of critical constraint violations is
observed, further underscoring the accuracy of the solution.


### Diffusion for Out-of-Distribution Detection on Road Scenes and Beyond

**PDF Url**: [2407.15739v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.15739v1)

**Abstract**: In recent years, research on out-of-distribution (OoD) detection for semantic
segmentation has mainly focused on road scenes -- a domain with a constrained
amount of semantic diversity. In this work, we challenge this constraint and
extend the domain of this task to general natural images. To this end, we
introduce: 1. the ADE-OoD benchmark, which is based on the ADE20k dataset and
includes images from diverse domains with a high semantic diversity, and 2. a
novel approach that uses Diffusion score matching for OoD detection (DOoD) and
is robust to the increased semantic diversity. ADE-OoD features indoor and
outdoor images, defines 150 semantic categories as in-distribution, and
contains a variety of OoD objects. For DOoD, we train a diffusion model with an
MLP architecture on semantic in-distribution embeddings and build on the score
matching interpretation to compute pixel-wise OoD scores at inference time. On
common road scene OoD benchmarks, DOoD performs on par or better than the state
of the art, without using outliers for training or making assumptions about the
data domain. On ADE-OoD, DOoD outperforms previous approaches, but leaves much
room for future improvements.


### Estimating Probability Densities with Transformer and Denoising Diffusion

**Abstract**: Transformers are often the go-to architecture to build foundation models that
ingest a large amount of training data. But these models do not estimate the
probability density distribution when trained on regression problems, yet
obtaining full probabilistic outputs is crucial to many fields of science,
where the probability distribution of the answer can be non-Gaussian and
multimodal. In this work, we demonstrate that training a probabilistic model
using a denoising diffusion head on top of the Transformer provides reasonable
probability density estimation even for high-dimensional inputs. The combined
Transformer+Denoising Diffusion model allows conditioning the output
probability density on arbitrary combinations of inputs and it is thus a highly
flexible density function emulator of all possible input/output combinations.
We illustrate our Transformer+Denoising Diffusion model by training it on a
large dataset of astronomical observations and measured labels of stars within
our Galaxy and we apply it to a variety of inference tasks to show that the
model can infer labels accurately with reasonable distributions.


### Discrete Flow Matching

**Abstract**: Despite Flow Matching and diffusion models having emerged as powerful
generative paradigms for continuous variables such as images and videos, their
application to high-dimensional discrete data, such as language, is still
limited. In this work, we present Discrete Flow Matching, a novel discrete flow
paradigm designed specifically for generating discrete data. Discrete Flow
Matching offers several key contributions: (i) it works with a general family
of probability paths interpolating between source and target distributions;
(ii) it allows for a generic formula for sampling from these probability paths
using learned posteriors such as the probability denoiser ($x$-prediction) and
noise-prediction ($\epsilon$-prediction); (iii) practically, focusing on
specific probability paths defined with different schedulers considerably
improves generative perplexity compared to previous discrete diffusion and flow
models; and (iv) by scaling Discrete Flow Matching models up to 1.7B
parameters, we reach 6.7% Pass@1 and 13.4% Pass@10 on HumanEval and 6.7% Pass@1
and 20.6% Pass@10 on 1-shot MBPP coding benchmarks. Our approach is capable of
generating high-quality discrete data in a non-autoregressive fashion,
significantly closing the gap between autoregressive models and discrete flow
models.

**PDF Url**: [2404.09260v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.09260v2)

**Abstract**: We construct an instruction dataset for the large language model (LLM) in the
Japanese finance domain. Domain adaptation of language models, including LLMs,
is receiving more attention as language models become more popular. This study
demonstrates the effectiveness of domain adaptation through instruction tuning.
To achieve this, we propose an instruction tuning data in Japanese called
JaFIn, the Japanese Financial Instruction Dataset. JaFIn is manually
constructed based on multiple data sources, including Japanese government
websites, which provide extensive financial knowledge. We then utilize JaFIn to
apply instruction tuning for several LLMs, demonstrating that our models
specialized in finance have better domain adaptability than the original
models. The financial-specialized LLMs created were evaluated using a
quantitative Japanese financial benchmark and qualitative response comparisons,
showing improved performance over the originals.
