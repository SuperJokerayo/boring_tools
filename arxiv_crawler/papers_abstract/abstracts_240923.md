**Abstract**: The effects of disorder and chaos on quantum many-body systems can be
superficially similar, yet their interplay has not been sufficiently explored.
This work finds a continuous phase transition when disorder breaks permutation
symmetry, with details of the transition being controlled by the degree of
chaos in the clean limit. The system changes from an area law entangled phase
in the permutation symmetric subspace where collective variables exist to
volume law entanglement in the full Hilbert space, beyond a critical strength
of the disorder. The critical strength tends to zero when the original disorder
free system is fully chaotic. We study this mainly via the scaling of the
collective spin of non-equilibrium states which transit to have properties of
what has been dubbed "deep Hilbert space". This has potential implications for
general many body physics, as well as technologies such as transmon qubits.

**Abstract**: We construct a pairwise measurement-based code on eight qubits that is error
correcting for circuit noise, with fault distance 3. The code can be
implemented on a subset of a rectangular array of qubits with nearest neighbor
connectivity of pairwise Pauli measurements, with a syndrome extraction circuit
of depth 28. We describe fault-tolerant logical operations on patches of this
eight-qubit code that generate the full Clifford group. We estimate the
performance under circuit noise both during logical idle and during a logical
two-qubit measurement. We estimate the pseudo-threshold to be between $10^{-5}$
and $2\times 10^{-4}$, depending on the amount of noise on idle physical
qubits. The use of post-selection in addition to error correction (correcting
all degree one faults and rejecting a subset of the higher degree faults) can
improve the pseudo-threshold by up to an order of magnitude.

**Abstract**: The physics of strongly correlated systems offers some of the most intriguing
physics challenges such as competing orders or the emergence of dynamical
composite degrees of freedom. Often, the resolution of these physics challenges
is computationally hard, but can be simplified enormously by a formulation in
terms of the dynamical degrees of freedom and within an expansion about the
physical ground state. Importantly, such a formulation does not only reduce or
minimise the computational challenges, it also facilitates the access to the
physics mechanisms at play. The tasks of finding the dynamical degrees of
freedom and the physical ground state can be systematically addressed within
the functional renormalisation group approach with flowing fields which
accommodates both, emergent composites as well as the physical ground state.
  In the present work we use this approach to set up physics-informed
renormalisation group flows (PIRG flows): Scale-dependent coordinate
transformations in field space induce emergent composites, and the respective
flows for the effective action generate a large set of target actions,
formulated in these emergent composite fields. This novel perspective on RG
flows bears a great potential both for conceptual as well as computational
applications: to begin with, PIRG flows allow for a systematic search of the
dynamical degrees of freedom and the respective ground state that leads to the
most rapid convergence of expansion schemes, thus minimising the computational
effort. Secondly, the resolution of the remaining computational tasks within a
given expansion scheme can be further reduced by optimising the physics content
within a given approximation. Thirdly, the maximal variability of PIRG flows
can be used to reduce the analytic and numerical effort of solving the flows
within a given approximation.


### SoloParkour: Constrained Reinforcement Learning for Visual Locomotion from Privileged Experience
**Authors**: Elliot Chane-Sane, Joseph Amigo, Thomas Flayols, Ludovic Righetti, Nicolas Mansard

**Published Date**: 2024-09-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-20

**PDF Url**: [2409.13678v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13678v1)

**Abstract**: Parkour poses a significant challenge for legged robots, requiring navigation
through complex environments with agility and precision based on limited
sensory inputs. In this work, we introduce a novel method for training
end-to-end visual policies, from depth pixels to robot control commands, to
achieve agile and safe quadruped locomotion. We formulate robot parkour as a
constrained reinforcement learning (RL) problem designed to maximize the
emergence of agile skills within the robot's physical limits while ensuring
safety. We first train a policy without vision using privileged information
about the robot's surroundings. We then generate experience from this
privileged policy to warm-start a sample efficient off-policy RL algorithm from
depth images. This allows the robot to adapt behaviors from this privileged
experience to visual locomotion while circumventing the high computational
costs of RL directly from pixels. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our
method on a real Solo-12 robot, showcasing its capability to perform a variety
of parkour skills such as walking, climbing, leaping, and crawling.

**Authors**: Dongyu Luo, Jianyu Wu, Jing Wang, Hairun Xie, Xiangyu Yue, Shixiang Tang

**Published Date**: 2024-09-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-20

**PDF Url**: [2409.13665v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13665v1)

**Abstract**: We showcase the plain diffusion models with Transformers are effective
predictors of fluid dynamics under various working conditions, e.g., Darcy flow
and high Reynolds number. Unlike traditional fluid dynamical solvers that
depend on complex architectures to extract intricate correlations and learn
underlying physical states, our approach formulates the prediction of flow
dynamics as the image translation problem and accordingly leverage the plain
diffusion model to tackle the problem. This reduction in model design
complexity does not compromise its ability to capture complex physical states
and geometric features of fluid dynamical equations, leading to high-precision
solutions. In preliminary tests on various fluid-related benchmarks, our
DiffFluid achieves consistent state-of-the-art performance, particularly in
solving the Navier-Stokes equations in fluid dynamics, with a relative
precision improvement of +44.8%. In addition, we achieved relative improvements
of +14.0% and +11.3% in the Darcy flow equation and the airfoil problem with
Euler's equation, respectively. Code will be released at
https://github.com/DongyuLUO/DiffFluid upon acceptance.


### Influence of Aharonov-Bohm flux and dual gaps on electron scattering in graphene quantum dots
**Authors**: Fatima Belokda, Ahmed Bouhlal, Ahmed Jellal

**Published Date**: 2024-09-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-20

**PDF Url**: [2409.13659v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13659v1)

**Abstract**: We show how the Aharonov-Bohm flux (AB) $\phi_i$ and the dual gaps
$(\Delta_1, \Delta_2)$ can affect the electron scattering in graphene quantum
dots (GQDs) of radius $r_0$ in the presence of an electrostatic potential $V$.
After obtaining the solutions of the energy spectrum, we explicitly determine
the radial component of the reflected current $J_r^r$, the square modulus of
the scattering coefficients $|c_m|^2$, and the scattering efficiency $Q$.
Different scattering regimes are identified based on physical parameters such
as incident energy $E$, $V$, $r_0$, dual gaps, and $\phi_i$. In particular, we
show that lower values of $E$ are associated with larger amplitudes of $Q$.
Furthermore, it is found that $Q$ exhibits a damped oscillatory behavior with
increasing the AB flux. In addition, increasing the external gap $\Delta_1$
resulted in higher values of $Q$. By increasing $\phi_i$, we show that the
oscillations in $|c_m|^2$ disappear for larger values of $r_0$ and are replaced
by prominent peaks at certain values of $E$ and angular momentum $m$. Finally,
we show that $J_{r}^r$ displays periodic oscillations of constant amplitude,
which are affected by the AB flux.

**Abstract**: Artificial spin ices are metamaterials composed of interacting nanomagnets
exhibiting frustration. Their resonant magnetization dynamics have been broadly
investigated from fundamental and applied points of view. In this work, we
realize a dynamically driven macroscopic mechano-magnetic artificial spin ice,
or macro-ASI, where permanent magnets are allowed to rotate on specially
designed hinges and exhibit natural resonance frequencies on the order of
several Hertz. A nonlinear dynamical regime is achieved experimentally and well
reproduced by numerical modelling. The modulation of the magnetic coupling
leads to a frequency comb that manifests itself as an amplitude-phase
modulation of the magnets' motion due to a metastable condition, i.e., a Hopf
bifurcation. Our results not only demonstrate a striking similarity across
different physical systems, but also suggest that the mechanism to enable
nonlinear phenomena could be realized in nanoscale systems using
microresonators decorated with magnetic materials to dynamically modulate their
coupling.

**PDF Url**: [2409.13654v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13654v1)

**Abstract**: The application of neural networks in modeling dynamic systems has become
prominent due to their ability to estimate complex nonlinear functions. Despite
their effectiveness, neural networks face challenges in long-term predictions,
where the prediction error diverges over time, thus degrading their accuracy.
This paper presents a neural filter to enhance the accuracy of long-term state
predictions of neural network-based models of dynamic systems. Motivated by the
extended Kalman filter, the neural filter combines the neural network state
predictions with the measurements from the physical system to improve the
estimated state's accuracy. The neural filter's improvements in prediction
accuracy are demonstrated through applications to four nonlinear dynamical
systems. Numerical experiments show that the neural filter significantly
improves prediction accuracy and bounds the state estimate covariance,
outperforming the neural network predictions.

**Abstract**: Creating a physiologically relevant shear stress in organ-on-a-chip (OOC)
devices requires careful tailoring of microfluidic flow parameters. It is
currently fairly common to use a simple approximation assuming a constant
viscosity, even for serum-based media. Here, we show that a popular nutrient
solution (Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium supplemented with Fetal Bovine
Serum) requires a more complex treatment (i.e., is a non-Newtonian fluid), with
observed shear stress values significantly greater than reported in literature.
We measure the rheology of the solutions and combine it with a 3-dimensional
flow field measurement to derive shear stress at the channel surface. We verify
the experiments with numerical simulations, finding good agreement and deriving
flow properties. Finally, we provide relevant expressions for shear stress
approximation, suitable for development of OOC devices with various geometries.


### Non-overlapping, Schwarz-type Domain Decomposition Method for Physics and Equality Constrained Artificial Neural Networks
**Authors**: Qifeng Hu, Shamsulhaq Basir, Inanc Senocak

**Published Date**: 2024-09-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-20

**PDF Url**: [2409.13644v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13644v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce a non-overlapping, Schwarz-type domain decomposition method
employing a generalized interface condition, tailored for physics-informed
machine learning of partial differential equations (PDEs) in both forward and
inverse scenarios. Our method utilizes physics and equality constrained
artificial neural networks (PECANN) in each subdomain. Diverging from the
original PECANN method, which uses initial and boundary conditions to constrain
the PDEs alone, our method jointly employs both the boundary conditions and
PDEs to constrain a specially formulated generalized interface loss function
for each subdomain. This modification enhances the learning of
subdomain-specific interface parameters, while delaying information exchange
between neighboring subdomains, and thereby significantly reduces communication
overhead. By utilizing an augmented Lagrangian method with a conditionally
adaptive update strategy, the constrained optimization problem in each
subdomain is transformed into a dual unconstrained problem. This approach
enables neural network training without the need for ad-hoc tuning of model
parameters. We demonstrate the generalization ability and robust parallel
performance of our method across a range of forward and inverse problems, with
solid parallel scaling performance up to 32 processes using the Message Passing
Interface model. A key strength of our approach is its capability to solve both
Laplace's and Helmholtz equations with multi-scale solutions within a unified
framework, highlighting its broad applicability and efficiency.

### HeadEvolver: Text to Head Avatars via Expressive and Attribute-Preserving Mesh Deformation
**Authors**: Duotun Wang, Hengyu Meng, Zeyu Cai, Zhijing Shao, Qianxi Liu, Lin Wang, Mingming Fan, Xiaohang Zhan, Zeyu Wang

**PDF Url**: [2403.09326v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09326v3)

**Abstract**: Current text-to-avatar methods often rely on implicit representations (e.g.,
NeRF, SDF, and DMTet), leading to 3D content that artists cannot easily edit
and animate in graphics software. This paper introduces a novel framework for
generating stylized head avatars from text guidance, which leverages locally
learnable mesh deformation and 2D diffusion priors to achieve high-quality
digital assets for attribute-preserving manipulation. Given a template mesh,
our method represents mesh deformation with per-face Jacobians and adaptively
modulates local deformation using a learnable vector field. This vector field
enables anisotropic scaling while preserving the rotation of vertices, which
can better express identity and geometric details. We employ landmark- and
contour-based regularization terms to balance the expressiveness and
plausibility of generated avatars from multiple views without relying on any
specific shape prior. Our framework can generate realistic shapes and textures
that can be further edited via text, while supporting seamless editing using
the preserved attributes from the template mesh, such as 3DMM parameters,
blendshapes, and UV coordinates. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our
framework can generate diverse and expressive head avatars with high-quality
meshes that artists can easily manipulate in graphics software, facilitating
downstream applications such as efficient asset creation and animation with
preserved attributes.


### Trustworthy Hate Speech Detection Through Visual Augmentation
**Authors**: Ziyuan Yang, Ming Yan, Yingyu Chen, Hui Wang, Zexin Lu, Yi Zhang

**Published Date**: 2024-09-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-20

**PDF Url**: [2409.13557v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13557v1)

**Abstract**: The surge of hate speech on social media platforms poses a significant
challenge, with hate speech detection~(HSD) becoming increasingly critical.
Current HSD methods focus on enriching contextual information to enhance
detection performance, but they overlook the inherent uncertainty of hate
speech. We propose a novel HSD method, named trustworthy hate speech detection
method through visual augmentation (TrusV-HSD), which enhances semantic
information through integration with diffused visual images and mitigates
uncertainty with trustworthy loss. TrusV-HSD learns semantic representations by
effectively extracting trustworthy information through multi-modal connections
without paired data. Our experiments on public HSD datasets demonstrate the
effectiveness of TrusV-HSD, showing remarkable improvements over conventional
methods.


### Invertible ResNets for Inverse Imaging Problems: Competitive Performance with Provable Regularization Properties
**Authors**: Clemens Arndt, Judith Nickel

**Published Date**: 2024-09-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-20

**PDF Url**: [2409.13482v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13482v1)

**Abstract**: Learning-based methods have demonstrated remarkable performance in solving
inverse problems, particularly in image reconstruction tasks. Despite their
success, these approaches often lack theoretical guarantees, which are crucial
in sensitive applications such as medical imaging. Recent works by Arndt et al
(2023 Inverse Problems 39 125018, 2024 Inverse Problems 40 045021) addressed
this gap by analyzing a data-driven reconstruction method based on invertible
residual networks (iResNets). They revealed that, under reasonable assumptions,
this approach constitutes a convergent regularization scheme. However, the
performance of the reconstruction method was only validated on academic toy
problems and small-scale iResNet architectures. In this work, we address this
gap by evaluating the performance of iResNets on two real-world imaging tasks:
a linear blurring operator and a nonlinear diffusion operator. To do so, we
extend some of the theoretical results from Arndt et al to encompass nonlinear
inverse problems and offer insights for the design of large-scale performant
iResNet architectures. Through numerical experiments, we compare the
performance of our iResNet models against state-of-the-art neural networks,
confirming their efficacy. Additionally, we numerically investigate the
theoretical guarantees of this approach and demonstrate how the invertibility
of the network enables a deeper analysis of the learned forward operator and
its learned regularization.


### High Perceptual Quality Wireless Image Delivery with Denoising Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Selim F. Yilmaz, Xueyan Niu, Bo Bai, Wei Han, Lei Deng, Deniz Gunduz

**Published Date**: 2023-09-27

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-20

**PDF Url**: [2309.15889v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2309.15889v2)

**Abstract**: We consider the image transmission problem over a noisy wireless channel via
deep learning-based joint source-channel coding (DeepJSCC) along with a
denoising diffusion probabilistic model (DDPM) at the receiver. Specifically,
we are interested in the perception-distortion trade-off in the practical
finite block length regime, in which separate source and channel coding can be
highly suboptimal. We introduce a novel scheme, where the conventional DeepJSCC
encoder targets transmitting a lower resolution version of the image, which
later can be refined thanks to the generative model available at the receiver.
In particular, we utilize the range-null space decomposition of the target
image; DeepJSCC transmits the range-space of the image, while DDPM
progressively refines its null space contents. Through extensive experiments,
we demonstrate significant improvements in distortion and perceptual quality of
reconstructed images compared to standard DeepJSCC and the state-of-the-art
generative learning-based method.


### Hydrogen under Pressure as a Benchmark for Machine-Learning Interatomic Potentials
**Authors**: Thomas Bischoff, Bastian Jäckl, Matthias Rupp

**Published Date**: 2024-09-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-20

**PDF Url**: [2409.13390v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.13390v1)

**Abstract**: Machine-learning interatomic potentials (MLPs) are fast, data-driven
surrogate models of atomistic systems' potential energy surfaces that can
accelerate ab-initio molecular dynamics (MD) simulations by several orders of
magnitude. The performance of MLPs is commonly measured as the prediction error
in energies and forces on data not used in their training. While low prediction
errors on a test set are necessary, they do not guarantee good performance in
MD simulations. The latter requires physically motivated performance measures
obtained from running accelerated simulations. However, the adoption of such
measures has been limited by the effort and domain knowledge required to
calculate and interpret them.
  To overcome this limitation, we present a benchmark that automatically
quantifies the performance of MLPs in MD simulations of a liquid-liquid phase
transition in hydrogen under pressure, a challenging benchmark system. The
benchmark's h-llpt-24 dataset provides reference geometries, energies, forces,
and stresses from density functional theory MD simulations at different
temperatures and mass densities. The benchmark's Python code automatically runs
MLP-accelerated MD simulations and calculates, quantitatively compares and
visualizes pressures, stable molecular fractions, diffusion coefficients, and
radial distribution functions. Employing this benchmark, we show that several
state-of-the-art MLPs fail to reproduce the liquid-liquid phase transition.
