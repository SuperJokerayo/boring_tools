**Abstract**: Neutrino oscillation experiments provide a unique window in exploring several
new physics scenarios beyond the standard three flavour. One such scenario is
quantum decoherence in neutrino oscillation which tends to destroy the
interference pattern of neutrinos reaching the far detector from the source. In
this work, we study the decoherence in neutrino oscillation in the context of
the ESSnuSB experiment. We consider the energy-independent decoherence
parameter and derive the analytical expressions for P$_{\mu e}$ and P$_{\mu
\mu}$ probabilities in vacuum. We have computed the capability of ESSnuSB to
put bounds on the decoherence parameters namely, $\Gamma_{21}$ and
$\Gamma_{32}$ and found that the constraints on $\Gamma_{21}$ are competitive
compared to the DUNE bounds and better than the most stringent LBL ones from
MINOS/MINOS+. We have also investigated the impact of decoherence on the
ESSnuSB measurement of the Dirac CP phase $\delta_{\rm CP}$ and concluded that
it remains robust in the presence of new physics.

**Abstract**: This paper explores the relativistic behavior of spin--half particles
possessing an Electric Dipole Moment (EDM) in a curved spacetime background
induced by a spiral dislocation. A thorough review of the mathematical
formulation of the Dirac spinor in the framework of quantum field theory sets
the foundation for our investigation. By deriving the action that governs the
interaction between the spinor field, the background spacetime, and an external
electric field, we establish a framework to study the dynamics of the system.
Solving the resulting wave equation reveals a set of coupled equations for the
radial components of the Dirac spinor, which give rise to a modified energy
spectrum attributed to the EDM. To validate our findings, we apply them to the
geometric phase and thermodynamics.

**Abstract**: The Swanson oscillator forms a prototypical example of a
$\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric and non-Hermitian system with a quadratic Hamiltonian.
The system is described by the generic quadratic Hamiltonian $\hat{H}_{\rm
Swanson} = \hbar \Omega_0 \big( \hat{a}^\dagger \hat{a} + \frac{1}{2}\big) +
\alpha \hat{a}^2 + \beta ({\hat{a}^\dagger})^2$, where $\Omega_0 > 0$, $\alpha,
\beta \in \mathbb{R}$, and $\alpha \neq \beta$. We show that such a system may
be realized as a harmonic oscillator in the presence of an imaginary-valued
gauge field. In the position representation, we solve the problem exactly,
i.e., we find the wavefunctions and the spectrum. We then also propose a
similar non-Hermitian and $\mathcal{PT}$-symmetric extension of the isotonic
oscillator which is exactly solved for a certain range of the parameters.

**Abstract**: Force-Free Electrodynamics (FFE) describes magnetically dominated
relativistic plasma via non-linear equations for the electromagnetic field
alone. Such plasma is thought to play a key role in the physics of pulsars and
active black holes. Despite its simple covariant formulation, FFE has primarily
been studied in 3+1 frameworks, where spacetime is split into space and time.
In this article we systematically develop the theory of force-free
magnetospheres taking a spacetime perspective. Using a suite of spacetime tools
and techniques (notably exterior calculus) we cover 1) the basics of the
theory, 2) exact solutions that demonstrate the extraction and transport of the
rotational energy of a compact object (in the case of a black hole, the
Blandford-Znajek mechanism), 3) the behavior of current sheets, 4) the general
theory of stationary, axisymmetric magnetospheres and 5) general properties of
pulsar and black hole magnetospheres. We thereby synthesize, clarify and
generalize known aspects of the physics of force-free magnetospheres, while
also introducing several new results.


### One-Dimensional, One-Phase and Two-Phase Eulerian Explicit Shock Tube Simulation Code

**PDF Url**: [2406.14018v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14018v3)

**Abstract**: In this work, a one-dimensional simulation code was developed for both
single-phase and two-phase systems, focusing on time-dependent Euler equations
for gas and particles. These equations, non-linear hyperbolic conservation
laws, describe the dynamics of compressible materials, where body forces,
viscous stresses, and heat flux are neglected. The Euler equations were
discretized using the finite volume method, and the code was written in MATLAB.
To test the accuracy of the computational fluid code, the Sod shock tube
problem, a physical analogue of the Riemann problem, was employed. This problem
models a pressure discontinuity where high and low-pressure regions are
separated by a diaphragm, which breaks at t=0, creating a discontinuity in
density as well. Exact solutions were used for code verification. A key focus
was on modeling a curtain of particles impacted by a shock wave, relevant to
multiphase heterogeneous cylindrical explosion studies by the PSAAP II project.
This initiative, funded by the US Department of Energy (DOE) National Nuclear
Security Administration (NNSA) Office of Advanced Simulation and Computing
(ASC), involves Sandia National Laboratories and the Center for Compressible
Multiphase Turbulence at the University of Florida. The propagation of
uncertainties in the maximum density of the particle curtain was studied by
varying initial curtain thickness and initial high density. Given the
computational expense of multiple code evaluations for uncertainty propagation,
a multi-fidelity surrogate model combining low and high-fidelity simulations
was implemented. This model facilitated uncertainty propagation using DAKOTA, a
flexible and extensible interface between analysis codes and iterative systems
analysis methods.

**Abstract**: Gravitational solitons (gravisolitons) are particular exact solutions of
Einstein field equation in vacuum build on a given background solution. Their
interpretation is not yet fully clear but they contain many of the physically
relevant solutions low $N$-solitons solutions. However, a systematic study and
characterization of gravisolitons solution for every $N$ is lacking and their
relevance in a theory of quantum gravity is not fully understood. This work
aims to investigate and characterize some properties of $N$-axialsoliton
solutions such as their asymptotically behaviour and asymptotic symmetries
given minimal assumptions on the background metric. We develop an explicit
systematic asymptotically expansion for the $N$-axialsoliton solution and we
compute the leading order of the asymptotic killing vectors. Moreover, in the
perspective to better understand the role of gravisolitons in quantum gravity
we make a link, and a one of the first explicit test, to the corner symmetry
proposal deriving which subalgebra of the universal corner symmetry algebra is
generated by the asymptotic Killing vectors of $N$-axialsoliton solution. In
the spirit of the corner proposal, the axialgravisoliton corner symmetry
algebra (\textfrak{agcsa}) can be useful for the quantization of the
non-asymptotically flat sector of gravity while, in the spirit of IR triangle,
new soft theorems and memory effects could emerge.


### Quantum Coding with Finite Thermodynamic Resources

**Abstract**: Quantum direct coding or Schumacher compression generalised the ideas of
Shannon theory, gave an operational meaning to the von Neumann entropy and
established the term qubit. But remembering that information processing is
carried out by physical processes prompts one to wonder what thermodynamic
resources are required to compress quantum information and how they constrain
one's ability to perform this task. That is, if Alice and Bob only have access
to thermal quantum states and clocks with finite accuracy, how well can they
measure, encode and decode pure quantum state messages? In this work we examine
these questions by modelling Alice's typical measurement as a unitary involving
a measurement probe, investigating imperfect timekeeping on encoding and
decoding and considering the role of temperature in Bob's appended qubits. In
doing so, we derive fidelity bounds for this protocol involving the
correlations Alice can form with their measurement probe, the variance of the
clock's ticks and the temperature of Bob's qubits. Finally, we give an insight
into the entropy produced by these two agents throughout the compression
protocol by relating the resources they use to a quantum thermodynamic cooling
protocol.


### An effective gauge field theory of the nucleon interactions
**Authors**: Eduard Boos

**Published Date**: 2023-08-11

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-02

**PDF Url**: [2308.06133v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.06133v3)

**Abstract**: We discuss the possibility of constructing an effective gauge field theory of
the nucleon interations based on the ideas of isotopic invariance as well as
hypercharge invariance as a local gauge symmetry and spontaneous breaking of
this symmetry. The constructed model predicts the structure of interactions of
protons and neutrons with $\rho$- and $\sigma$-mesons, with pi-mesons and
photons, as well as interactions of these particles with each other. The
Lagrangian of the model consists of several parts parts involving dimension 4
and 5 gauge invariant operators. Feynman rules for physical degrees of freedom
as follow from the Lagrangian define the structure of diagrams for one-boson
exchanges between nucleons predicting the internucleon one-boson exchange
potential as well as nucleon scattering amplitudes. The range of applicability
of the model is discussed and estimates are made of the resulting coupling
constants. The model predicts the mass of the neutral $\rho^0$-meson to be
about $1\,MeV$ larger than the mass of the charged mesons $\rho^{\pm}$. The
vector $\omega$-meson, which is a sterile particle with respect to the
considered gauge group $SU_I(2)\times U_Y(1)$, can be added to the scheme by
means of a gauge-invariant operator of dimension 5, as shown in Appendix ~A.

**Abstract**: Quantum networks consist of various quantum technologies, spread across vast
distances, and involve various users at the same time. Certifying the
functioning and efficiency of the individual components is a task that is well
studied and widely used. However, the power of quantum networks can only be
realized by integrating all the required quantum technologies and platforms
across a large number of users. In this work, we demonstrate how to certify the
distillable entanglement available in multipartite states produced by quantum
networks, without relying on the physical realization of its constituent
components. We do so by using the paradigm of device independence.

**Authors**: CMS Collaboration

**PDF Url**: [2408.01344v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.01344v1)

**Abstract**: This Letter presents the first search for bottom quark associated production
of the standard model Higgs boson, in final states with leptons. Higgs boson
decays to pairs of tau leptons and pairs of leptonically decaying W bosons are
considered. The search is performed using data collected from 2016 to 2018 by
the CMS experiment in proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of 13
TeV, corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 138 fb${-1}$. Upper limits at
the 95% confidence level are placed on the signal strength for Higgs boson
production in association with bottom quarks; the observed (expected) upper
limit is 3.7 (6.1) times the standard model prediction.

**Abstract**: Generative models have achieved remarkable success in image, video, and text
domains. Inspired by this, researchers have explored utilizing generative
models to generate neural network parameters. However, these efforts have been
limited by the parameter size and the practicality of generating
high-performance parameters. In this paper, we propose COND P-DIFF, a novel
approach that demonstrates the feasibility of controllable high-performance
parameter generation, particularly for LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) weights,
during the fine-tuning process. Specifically, we employ an autoencoder to
extract efficient latent representations for parameters. We then train a
conditional latent diffusion model to synthesize high-performing model
parameters from random noise based on specific task conditions. Experimental
results in both computer vision and natural language processing domains
consistently demonstrate that COND P-DIFF can generate high-performance
parameters conditioned on the given task. Moreover, we observe that the
parameter distribution generated by COND P-DIFF exhibits differences compared
to the distribution obtained through normal optimization methods, indicating a
certain level of generalization capability. Our work paves the way for further
exploration of condition-driven parameter generation, offering a promising
direction for task-specific adaptation of neural networks.


### CCVA-FL: Cross-Client Variations Adaptive Federated Learning for Medical Imaging
**Authors**: Sunny Gupta, Amit Sethi

**Published Date**: 2024-07-16

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-02

**PDF Url**: [2407.11652v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.11652v3)

**Abstract**: Federated Learning (FL) offers a privacy-preserving approach to train models
on decentralized data. Its potential in healthcare is significant, but
challenges arise due to cross-client variations in medical image data,
exacerbated by limited annotations. This paper introduces Cross-Client
Variations Adaptive Federated Learning (CCVA-FL) to address these issues.
CCVA-FL aims to minimize cross-client variations by transforming images into a
common feature space. It involves expert annotation of a subset of images from
each client, followed by the selection of a client with the least data
complexity as the target. Synthetic medical images are then generated using
Scalable Diffusion Models with Transformers (DiT) based on the target client's
annotated images. These synthetic images, capturing diversity and representing
the original data, are shared with other clients. Each client then translates
its local images into the target image space using image-to-image translation.
The translated images are subsequently used in a federated learning setting to
develop a server model. Our results demonstrate that CCVA-FL outperforms
Vanilla Federated Averaging by effectively addressing data distribution
differences across clients without compromising privacy.


### Improving Geo-diversity of Generated Images with Contextualized Vendi Score Guidance

**PDF Url**: [2406.04551v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.04551v2)

**Abstract**: With the growing popularity of text-to-image generative models, there has
been increasing focus on understanding their risks and biases. Recent work has
found that state-of-the-art models struggle to depict everyday objects with the
true diversity of the real world and have notable gaps between geographic
regions. In this work, we aim to increase the diversity of generated images of
common objects such that per-region variations are representative of the real
world. We introduce an inference time intervention, contextualized Vendi Score
Guidance (c-VSG), that guides the backwards steps of latent diffusion models to
increase the diversity of a sample as compared to a "memory bank" of previously
generated images while constraining the amount of variation within that of an
exemplar set of real-world contextualizing images. We evaluate c-VSG with two
geographically representative datasets and find that it substantially increases
the diversity of generated images, both for the worst performing regions and on
average, while simultaneously maintaining or improving image quality and
consistency. Additionally, qualitative analyses reveal that diversity of
generated images is significantly improved, including along the lines of
reductive region portrayals present in the original model. We hope that this
work is a step towards text-to-image generative models that reflect the true
geographic diversity of the world.


### A Reparameterized Discrete Diffusion Model for Text Generation
**Authors**: Lin Zheng, Jianbo Yuan, Lei Yu, Lingpeng Kong

**Published Date**: 2023-02-11

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-02

**PDF Url**: [2302.05737v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2302.05737v3)

**Abstract**: This work studies discrete diffusion probabilistic models with applications
to natural language generation. We derive an alternative yet equivalent
formulation of the sampling from discrete diffusion processes and leverage this
insight to develop a family of reparameterized discrete diffusion models. The
derived generic framework is highly flexible, offers a fresh perspective of the
generation process in discrete diffusion models, and features more effective
training and decoding techniques. We conduct extensive experiments to evaluate
the text generation capability of our model, demonstrating significant
improvements over existing diffusion models.


### DragD3D: Realistic Mesh Editing with Rigidity Control Driven by 2D Diffusion Priors

**Abstract**: Direct mesh editing and deformation are key components in the geometric
modeling and animation pipeline. Mesh editing methods are typically framed as
optimization problems combining user-specified vertex constraints with a
regularizer that determines the position of the rest of the vertices. The
choice of the regularizer is key to the realism and authenticity of the final
result. Physics and geometry-based regularizers are not aware of the global
context and semantics of the object, and the more recent deep learning priors
are limited to a specific class of 3D object deformations. Our main
contribution is a vertex-based mesh editing method called DragD3D based on (1)
a novel optimization formulation that decouples the rotation and stretch
components of the deformation and combines a 3D geometric regularizer with (2)
the recently introduced DDS loss which scores the faithfulness of the rendered
2D image to one from a diffusion model. Thus, our deformation method achieves
globally realistic shape deformation which is not restricted to any class of
objects. Our new formulation optimizes directly the transformation of the
neural Jacobian field explicitly separating the rotational and stretching
components. The objective function of the optimization combines the approximate
gradients of DDS and the gradients from the geometric loss to satisfy the
vertex constraints. Additional user control over desired global shape
deformation is made possible by allowing explicit per-triangle deformation
control as well as explicit separation of rotational and stretching components
of the deformation. We show that our deformations can be controlled to yield
realistic shape deformations that are aware of the global context of the
objects, and provide better results than just using geometric regularizers.
