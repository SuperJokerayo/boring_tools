**Abstract**: We present a computational tool, TweedleDEE, for empirically modeling diffuse
gamma-ray background emission in a 1 degree region of the sky, using publicly
available gamma-ray data slightly off-axis from this region. This background
model allows a user to perform a purely data-driven search for anomalous
localized sources of gamma-ray emission, including new physics. As an
application, we use TweedleDEE and the MADHATv2 package to perform the first
search for dark matter annihilation in the newly discovered Leo VI dwarf
spheroidal galaxy, and present model constraints for a variety of choices of
the annihilation channel and velocity dependence of the cross section.

**Abstract**: Coronal mass ejections (CMEs) are magnetized plasma systems with highly
complex magnetic topology and evolution. Methods developed to assess their
magnetic configuration have primarily focused on reconstructing
three-dimensional representations from one-dimensional time series measurements
taken in situ using techniques based on the "highly twisted magnetic flux rope"
approximations. However, the magnetic fields of CMEs is know to have more
complicated geometries. Their structure can be quantified using measures of
field line topology, which have been primarily used for solar physics research.
In this work, we introduce a novel technique of directly quantifying the
various form of magnetic helicity within a CME in the interplanetary space
using synthetic in situ measurements. We use a relatively simple
three-dimensional simulation of a CME initiated with a highly-twisted flux
rope. We find that a significant portion of the magnetic helicity near 1~au is
contained in writhe and mutual helicity rather than just in twist. We discuss
the implications of this finding for fitting and reconstruction techniques.


### A physical proof of the topological entanglement entropy inequality

**Abstract**: Recently it was shown that the topological entanglement entropy (TEE) of a
two-dimensional gapped ground state obeys the universal inequality $\gamma \geq
\log \mathcal{D}$, where $\gamma$ is the TEE and $\mathcal{D}$ is the total
quantum dimension of all anyon excitations, $\mathcal{D} = \sqrt{\sum_a
d_a^2}$. Here we present an alternative, more direct proof of this inequality.
Our proof uses only the strong subadditivity property of the von Neumann
entropy together with a few physical assumptions about the ground state density
operator. Our derivation naturally generalizes to a variety of systems,
including spatially inhomogeneous systems with defects and boundaries, higher
dimensional systems, and mixed states.


### Time-cost-error trade-off relation in thermodynamics: The third law and beyond

**Abstract**: Elucidating the fundamental limitations inherent in physical systems is a
central subject in physics. For important thermodynamic operations such as
information erasure, cooling, and copying, resources like time and energetic
cost must be expended to achieve the desired outcome within a predetermined
error margin. In this study, we introduce the concept of {\it separated
states}, which consist of fully unoccupied and occupied states. This concept
generalizes many critical states involved in relevant thermodynamic operations.
We uncover a three-way trade-off relation between {\it time}, {\it cost}, and
{\it error} for a general class of thermodynamic operations aimed at creating
separated states, simply expressed as $\tau{\cal C}\varepsilon_{\tau}\ge
1-\eta$. This fundamental relation is applicable to diverse thermodynamic
operations, including information erasure, cooling, and copying. It provides a
profound quantification of the unattainability principle in the third law of
thermodynamics in a general form. Building upon this relation, we explore the
quantitative limitations governing cooling operations, the preparation of
separated states, and a no-go theorem for exact classical copying. Furthermore,
we extend these findings to the quantum regime, encompassing both Markovian and
non-Markovian dynamics. Specifically, within Lindblad dynamics, we derive a
similar three-way trade-off relation that quantifies the cost of achieving a
pure state with a given error. The generalization to general quantum dynamics
involving a system coupled to a finite bath implies that heat dissipation
becomes infinite as the quantum system is exactly cooled down to the ground
state or perfectly reset to a pure state, thereby resolving an open question
regarding the thermodynamic cost of information erasure.


### Modelling shallow confinement in tuneable quantum dots

**Abstract**: This paper proposes a universal microscopic model for the shallow confinement
regime of single-electron tunneling devices. We consider particle escape from a
quantum well generically emerging as a bifurcation in a smooth electrostatic
potential and develop a set of analytic and numerical approximations for the
ground-state tunneling and thermally activated escape rates. These
approximations are applied to the problem of electron capture by a closing
tunnel barrier where the competition between the closing speed and the escape
rate defines a scaling relation for the capture fidelity. Effective
one-dimensional cubic potential approximation leads to a universal form of this
scaling relation in terms of device-independent dimensionless depth and speed
parameters. Using predictions for temperature and magnetic-field dependence we
show how to infer the energy scales of cubic longitudinal and quadratic
transverse confinement. Finally, we derive an intrinsic quantum speed bound for
adiabatic protection of the ground state tunneling and show that the latter can
potentially be exploited up to the break down of confinement with a practical
speed limit set by reaching the quantum uncertainty of the barrier height
before the onset of non-adiabatic excitation. These results contribute to
mapping out the physical limits of single-electron quantum technologies for
electrical metrology and sensing.

**Abstract**: The current dropout rate in physics studies in Germany is about 60\%, with
the majority of dropouts occurring in the first year. Consequently, the physics
study entry phase poses a significant challenge for many students. Students'
stress perceptions can provide more profound insights into the processes and
challenges during that period. In a panel study featuring 67 measuring points
involving up to 128 participants at each point, we investigated students'
stress perceptions with the Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), identified
underlying sources of stress, and assessed self-estimated workloads across two
different cohorts. This examination occurred almost every week during the first
semester, and for one cohort also in the second semester, yielding a total of
3,241 PSQ data points and 5,823 stressors. The PSQ data indicate a consistent
stress trajectory across all three groups studied that is characterized by
significant dynamics between measuring points, spanning from $M=20.1, SD=15.9$
to $M=63.6, SD=13.4$ on a scale from 0 to 100. Stress levels rise in the first
weeks of the lecture, followed by stable, elevated stress levels until the
exams and a relaxation phase afterward during the lecture-free time and
Christmas vacation. In the first half of the lecture period, students primarily
indicated the weekly exercise sheets, the physics lab course, and math courses
as stressors; later on, preparation for exams and the exams themselves emerged
as the most important stressors. Together with the students' self-estimated
workloads that correlate with the PSQ scores, we can create a coherent picture
of stress perceptions among first-year physics students, which builds the basis
for supportive measures and interventions.


### Interference Resurrection of the $Ï„$ Dipole through Quantum Tomography
**Authors**: Prisco Lo Chiatto

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-08

**PDF Url**: [2408.04553v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04553v1)

**Abstract**: Helicity selection rules can defy the expectation that the leading
contributions from Standard Model Effective Field Theory operators occur at
dimension 6, potentially reducing sensitivity to new physics scenarios. This
paper investigates how spin correlations can restore ("resurrect") the
interference contributions of the $\tau$ lepton's anomalous dipole moment. We
first illustrate the mechanism for this interference restoration using a simple
quantum mechanical example. We then calculate the sensitivity of these spin
correlations to new physics. Additionally, we compute quantum information
observables, namely measures of entanglement, Bell inequality violation, and
the irreducible quantum uncertainty of the $\tau\tau$ state. Our findings show
that spin correlation observables outperform both the cross-section and quantum
information observables, by providing greater sensitivity to new physics and
preserving information about $CP$ violation.


### Synchronous Multi-modal Semantic CommunicationSystem with Packet-level Coding

**PDF Url**: [2408.04535v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04535v1)

**Abstract**: Although the semantic communication with joint semantic-channel coding design
has shown promising performance in transmitting data of different modalities
over physical layer channels, the synchronization and packet-level forward
error correction of multimodal semantics have not been well studied. Due to the
independent design of semantic encoders, synchronizing multimodal features in
both the semantic and time domains is a challenging problem. In this paper, we
take the facial video and speech transmission as an example and propose a
Synchronous Multimodal Semantic Communication System (SyncSC) with Packet-Level
Coding. To achieve semantic and time synchronization, 3D Morphable Mode (3DMM)
coefficients and text are transmitted as semantics, and we propose a semantic
codec that achieves similar quality of reconstruction and synchronization with
lower bandwidth, compared to traditional methods. To protect semantic packets
under the erasure channel, we propose a packet-Level Forward Error Correction
(FEC) method, called PacSC, that maintains a certain visual quality performance
even at high packet loss rates. Particularly, for text packets, a text packet
loss concealment module, called TextPC, based on Bidirectional Encoder
Representations from Transformers (BERT) is proposed, which significantly
improves the performance of traditional FEC methods. The simulation results
show that our proposed SyncSC reduce transmission overhead and achieve
high-quality synchronous transmission of video and speech over the packet loss
network.


### Multidimensionality of the Hubble tension: the roles of $Î©_m$ and $Ï‰_c$
**Authors**: Davide Pedrotti, Jun-Qian Jiang, Luis A. Escamilla, Simony Santos da Costa, Sunny Vagnozzi

**Published Date**: 2024-08-08

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-08

**PDF Url**: [2408.04530v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04530v1)

**Abstract**: The Hubble tension is inherently multidimensional, and bears important
implications for parameters beyond $H_0$. We discuss the key role of the matter
density parameter $\Omega_m$ and the physical cold dark matter density
$\omega_c$. We argue that once $\Omega_m$ and the physical baryon density
$\omega_b$ are calibrated, through Baryon Acoustic Oscillations (BAO) and/or
Type Ia Supernovae (SNeIa) for $\Omega_m$, and via Big Bang Nucleosynthesis for
$\omega_b$, any model raising $H_0$ inevitably raises $\omega_c$ and, under
minimal assumptions, the clustering parameter $S_8$. We explicitly verify that
this behaviour holds when analyzing recent BAO and SNeIa data. We argue that a
calibration of $\Omega_m$ which is as reliable and model-independent as
possible should be a priority in the Hubble tension discussion, and an
interesting possibility in this sense could be represented by galaxy cluster
gas mass fraction measurements.

**Abstract**: Electronic resonances are metastable states that can decay by electron loss.
They are ubiquitous across various fields of science, such as chemistry,
physics, and biology. However, current theoretical and computational models for
resonances cannot yet rival the level of accuracy achieved by bound-state
methodologies. Here, we generalize selected configuration interaction (SCI) to
treat resonances using the complex absorbing potential (CAP) technique. By
modifying the selection procedure and the extrapolation protocol of standard
SCI, the resulting CAP-SCI method yields resonance positions and widths of full
configuration interaction quality. Initial results for the shape resonances of
\ce{N2-} and \ce{CO-} reveal the important effect of high-order correlation,
which shifts the values obtained with CAP-augmented equation-of-motion
coupled-cluster with singles and doubles by more than \SI{0.1}{\eV}. The
present CAP-SCI approach represents a cornerstone in the development of
highly-accurate methodologies for resonances.


## Diffusion
### Puppet-Master: Scaling Interactive Video Generation as a Motion Prior for Part-Level Dynamics
**Authors**: Ruining Li, Chuanxia Zheng, Christian Rupprecht, Andrea Vedaldi

**Published Date**: 2024-08-08

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-08

**PDF Url**: [2408.04631v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04631v1)

**Abstract**: We present Puppet-Master, an interactive video generative model that can
serve as a motion prior for part-level dynamics. At test time, given a single
image and a sparse set of motion trajectories (i.e., drags), Puppet-Master can
synthesize a video depicting realistic part-level motion faithful to the given
drag interactions. This is achieved by fine-tuning a large-scale pre-trained
video diffusion model, for which we propose a new conditioning architecture to
inject the dragging control effectively. More importantly, we introduce the
all-to-first attention mechanism, a drop-in replacement for the widely adopted
spatial attention modules, which significantly improves generation quality by
addressing the appearance and background issues in existing models. Unlike
other motion-conditioned video generators that are trained on in-the-wild
videos and mostly move an entire object, Puppet-Master is learned from
Objaverse-Animation-HQ, a new dataset of curated part-level motion clips. We
propose a strategy to automatically filter out sub-optimal animations and
augment the synthetic renderings with meaningful motion trajectories.
Puppet-Master generalizes well to real images across various categories and
outperforms existing methods in a zero-shot manner on a real-world benchmark.

**PDF Url**: [2408.04594v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.04594v1)

**Abstract**: High-performance Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) rely heavily on
data quality. This study introduces a novel dataset named Img-Diff, designed to
enhance fine-grained image recognition in MLLMs by leveraging insights from
contrastive learning and image difference captioning. By analyzing object
differences between similar images, we challenge models to identify both
matching and distinct components. We utilize the Stable-Diffusion-XL model and
advanced image editing techniques to create pairs of similar images that
highlight object replacements. Our methodology includes a Difference Area
Generator for object differences identifying, followed by a Difference Captions
Generator for detailed difference descriptions. The result is a relatively
small but high-quality dataset of "object replacement" samples. We use the the
proposed dataset to fine-tune state-of-the-art (SOTA) MLLMs such as MGM-7B,
yielding comprehensive improvements of performance scores over SOTA models that
trained with larger-scale datasets, in numerous image difference and Visual
Question Answering tasks. For instance, our trained models notably surpass the
SOTA models GPT-4V and Gemini on the MMVP benchmark. Besides, we investigate
alternative methods for generating image difference data through "object
removal" and conduct thorough evaluation to confirm the dataset's diversity,
quality, and robustness, presenting several insights on synthesis of such
contrastive dataset. To encourage further research and advance the field of
multimodal data synthesis and enhancement of MLLMs' fundamental capabilities
for image understanding, we release our codes and dataset at
https://github.com/modelscope/data-juicer/tree/ImgDiff.


### Long and Short Guidance in Score identity Distillation for One-Step Text-to-Image Generation

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based text-to-image generation models trained on extensive
text-image pairs have shown the capacity to generate photorealistic images
consistent with textual descriptions. However, a significant limitation of
these models is their slow sample generation, which requires iterative
refinement through the same network. In this paper, we enhance Score identity
Distillation (SiD) by developing long and short classifier-free guidance (LSG)
to efficiently distill pretrained Stable Diffusion models without using real
training data. SiD aims to optimize a model-based explicit score matching loss,
utilizing a score-identity-based approximation alongside the proposed LSG for
practical computation. By training exclusively with fake images synthesized
with its one-step generator, SiD equipped with LSG rapidly improves FID and
CLIP scores, achieving state-of-the-art FID performance while maintaining a
competitive CLIP score. Specifically, its data-free distillation of Stable
Diffusion 1.5 achieves a record low FID of 8.15 on the COCO-2014 validation
set, with a CLIP score of 0.304 at an LSG scale of 1.5, and an FID of 9.56 with
a CLIP score of 0.313 at an LSG scale of 2. Our code and distilled one-step
text-to-image generators are available at

**Abstract**: Graph generation addresses the problem of generating new graphs that have a
data distribution similar to real-world graphs. While previous diffusion-based
graph generation methods have shown promising results, they often struggle to
scale to large graphs. In this work, we propose ARROW-Diff (AutoRegressive
RandOm Walk Diffusion), a novel random walk-based diffusion approach for
efficient large-scale graph generation. Our method encompasses two components
in an iterative process of random walk sampling and graph pruning. We
demonstrate that ARROW-Diff can scale to large graphs efficiently, surpassing
other baseline methods in terms of both generation time and multiple graph
statistics, reflecting the high quality of the generated graphs.


### Reinforcement Learning for Jump-Diffusions, with Financial Applications
**Authors**: Xuefeng Gao, Lingfei Li, Xun Yu Zhou

**Published Date**: 2024-05-26

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-08

**PDF Url**: [2405.16449v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.16449v2)

**Abstract**: We study continuous-time reinforcement learning (RL) for stochastic control
in which system dynamics are governed by jump-diffusion processes. We formulate
an entropy-regularized exploratory control problem with stochastic policies to
capture the exploration--exploitation balance essential for RL. Unlike the pure
diffusion case initially studied by Wang et al. (2020), the derivation of the
exploratory dynamics under jump-diffusions calls for a careful formulation of
the jump part. Through a theoretical analysis, we find that one can simply use
the same policy evaluation and $q$-learning algorithms in Jia and Zhou (2022a,
2023), originally developed for controlled diffusions, without needing to check
a priori whether the underlying data come from a pure diffusion or a
jump-diffusion. However, we show that the presence of jumps ought to affect
parameterizations of actors and critics in general. We investigate as an
application the mean--variance portfolio selection problem with stock price
modelled as a jump-diffusion, and show that both RL algorithms and
parameterizations are invariant with respect to jumps. Finally, we present a
detailed study on applying the general theory to option hedging.
