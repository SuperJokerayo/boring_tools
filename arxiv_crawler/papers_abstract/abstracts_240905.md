**Abstract**: This research focuses on solving time-dependent partial differential
equations (PDEs), in particular the time-dependent Schr\"odinger equation,
using matrix product states (MPS). We propose an extension of Hermite
Distributed Approximating Functionals (HDAF) to MPS, a highly accurate
pseudospectral method for approximating functions of derivatives. Integrating
HDAF into an MPS finite precision algebra, we test four types of
quantum-inspired algorithms for time evolution: explicit Runge-Kutta methods,
Crank-Nicolson method, explicitly restarted Arnoli iteration and split-step.
The benchmark problem is the expansion of a particle in a quantum quench,
characterized by a rapid increase in space requirements, where HDAF surpasses
traditional finite difference methods in accuracy with a comparable cost.
Moreover, the efficient HDAF approximation to the free propagator avoids the
need for Fourier transforms in split-step methods, significantly enhancing
their performance with an improved balance in cost and accuracy. Both
approaches exhibit similar error scaling and run times compared to FFT vector
methods; however, MPS offer an exponential advantage in memory, overcoming
vector limitations to enable larger discretizations and expansions. Finally,
the MPS HDAF split-step method successfully reproduces the physical behavior of
a particle expansion in a double-well potential, demonstrating viability for
actual research scenarios.


### A New Solution to the Callan Rubakov Effect

**Abstract**: In this paper we study the scattering of massive fermions off of smooth,
spherically symmetric monopoles in $4d$ $SU(2)$ gauge theory. We propose a
complete physical picture of the monopole-fermion interaction which encompasses
all angular momentum modes. We show that as an in-going fermion scatters off a
monopole, it excites trapped $W$-bosons in the monopole core by a version of
the Witten effect so that the monopole can accrue charge and transform into a
dyon at parametrically low energies. The imparted electric charge is then
protected from decay by an emergent $\mathbb{Z}_N$ generalized global symmetry,
creating a stable dyon. At sufficiently low energies, the scattered fermion can
be trapped by the dyon's electrostatic potential, forming a bound state, which
can decay into spherically symmetric fermion modes subject to the preserved
$\mathbb{Z}_N$ global symmetry. We propose that monopole-fermion scattering can
be described in this way without needing to add ``new'' states to the Hilbert
space, thereby eliminating a long standing confusion in the Callan Rubakov
effect.

**Abstract**: Physics-informed machine learning (PIML) as a means of solving partial
differential equations (PDE) has garnered much attention in the Computational
Science and Engineering (CS&E) world. This topic encompasses a broad array of
methods and models aimed at solving a single or a collection of PDE problems,
called multitask learning. PIML is characterized by the incorporation of
physical laws into the training process of machine learning models in lieu of
large data when solving PDE problems. Despite the overall success of this
collection of methods, it remains incredibly difficult to analyze, benchmark,
and generally compare one approach to another. Using Kolmogorov n-widths as a
measure of effectiveness of approximating functions, we judiciously apply this
metric in the comparison of various multitask PIML architectures. We compute
lower accuracy bounds and analyze the model's learned basis functions on
various PDE problems. This is the first objective metric for comparing
multitask PIML architectures and helps remove uncertainty in model validation
from selective sampling and overfitting. We also identify avenues of
improvement for model architectures, such as the choice of activation function,
which can drastically affect model generalization to "worst-case" scenarios,
which is not observed when reporting task-specific errors. We also incorporate
this metric into the optimization process through regularization, which
improves the models' generalizability over the multitask PDE problem.

**PDF Url**: [2409.02900v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02900v1)

**Abstract**: We present the basic properties of a new physical system: an individual V2+
ion embedded into an individual quantum dot. The system is realized utilizing
molecular beam epitaxy and it is observed using a low-temperature
polarization-resolved magneto-photoluminescence. The nature of the system is
confirmed by observation of the excitonic lines split due to the interactions
of a vanadium ion with carriers confined in a CdTe/ZnTe quantum dot. Observed
data are explained by the numerical modeling which includes s,p-d exchange
interaction, Zeeman splitting of the exciton and the ion, diamagnetic shift,
and the presence of shear strain within the quantum dot. The fundamental state
of vanadium exhibits a spin 1/2 making this system a textbook localized qubit.

**Abstract**: Thermal machines are physical systems specifically designed to make thermal
energy available for practical use through state transformations in a cyclic
process. This concept relies on the presence of an additional element equipped
with a clock, controlling which interaction Hamiltonian between the system and
the reservoirs must act at a certain time and that remains unaffected during
this process. In the domain of quantum dynamics, there is substantial evidence
to suggest that fulfilling this final condition is, in fact, impossible, except
in ideal and far-from-reality cases. In this study we start from one such
idealized condition and proceed to relax the primary approximations to make the
model more realistic and less ideal. The main result is a fully quantum
description of the engine-clock dynamics within a realistic quantum framework.
Furthermore, this approach offers the possibility to address the deeper and
more fundamental challenge of defining meaningful time operators in the realm
of quantum mechanics from a different standpoint.


### Semiquantum private comparison based on Bell states without quantum measurements from the classical user

**PDF Url**: [2205.04927v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2205.04927v4)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we propose a novel semiquantum private comparison (SQPC)
protocol based on Bell states, which enables one quantum user and one classical
user to compare the equality of their private inputs with the help of a
semi-honest quantum third party (TP). TP is assumed to be semi-honest in the
sense that she may take all possible attacks to steal users' private inputs
except conspiring with anyone. The security analysis validates that our
protocol can resist not only the attacks from internal participants but also
the attacks from an external eavesdropper. Besides, our protocol only asks TP
to perform Bell basis measurements but doesn't need quantum entanglement
swapping; and it releases the classical user from conducting quantum
measurements and having a quantum memory. Moreover, our protocol can take
advantage over previous SQPC protocols based on Bell states in qubit
efficiency. Finally, our protocol can be generalized into its counterpart of
the collective-dephasing noise quantum channel.

**PDF Url**: [2409.02827v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02827v1)

**Abstract**: The KNT(W) data-driven determinations of the hadronic vacuum polarization
(HVP) are crucial inputs to previous and future Standard Model (SM) predictions
of the muon's anomalous magnetic moment, $a_\mu$. With the muon $g$$-$$2$'s new
physics case uncertain due to disagreeing HVP evaluations, new SM predictions
and experimental measurements of $a_\mu$ expected soon, and a complete revamp
of the KNTW analysis framework underway, this letter motivates and describes a
blinding scheme for data-driven HVP determinations that has been implemented
for future KNTW analyses.

**Abstract**: The forthcoming Electron--Ion Collider (EIC), which is expected to commence
operations in the early 2030s, has already reached several significant
milestones on its path toward completion. The core of the EIC physics program
is the 3D imaging of partonic structures in protons and nuclei. The
experimental detector setup required to enable this primary objective utilizes
"far-forward" (FF) and "far-backward" (FB) detectors positioned downstream in
the hadron-going and electron-going directions, respectively, from the
interaction point of the EIC. The primary purpose of the FB detectors is to
monitor luminosity and measure scattered electrons in collisions in the EIC,
while the array of FF detectors is used to tag and reconstruct both charged and
neutral particles that scatter at small angles. These detectors also enable a
broader physics program than was initially envisioned, enhancing the EIC's
research potential. The expanded capabilities have been a prime focus for
engaging the broader nuclear physics community to build a robust groundwork for
the EIC. In these proceedings, we will describe the FF/FB detectors and review
the advanced forward physics program facilitated by them at the EIC.


### Understanding the puzzle of angular momentum conservation in beta decay and related processes

**Published Date**: 2024-05-23

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-04

**PDF Url**: [2405.15011v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.15011v2)

**Abstract**: We ask the question of how angular momentum is conserved in electroweak
interaction processes. To introduce the problem with a minimum of mathematics,
we first raise the same issue in elastic scattering of a circularly polarized
photon by an atom, where the scattered photon has a different spin direction
than the original photon, and note its presence in scattering of a fully
relativistic spin-1/2 particle by a central potential. We then consider inverse
beta decay in which an electron is emitted following the capture of a neutrino
on a nucleus. While both the incident neutrino and final electron spins are
antiparallel to their momenta, the final spin is in a different direction than
that of the neutrino -- an apparent change of angular momentum. However, prior
to measurement of the final particle, in all these cases angular momentum is
indeed conserved, The apparent non-conservation of angular momentum arises in
the quantum measurement process in which the measuring apparatus does not have
an initially well-defined angular momentum, but is localized in the outside
world. We generalize the discussion to massive neutrinos and electrons, and
examine nuclear beta decay and electron-positron annihilation processes through
the same lens, enabling physically transparent derivations of angular and
helicity distributions in these reactions.

**Abstract**: The Josephson diode effect (JDE), characterized by asymmetric critical
currents in a Josephson junction, has drawn considerable attention in the field
of condensed matter physics. We investigate the conditions under which JDE can
manifest in a one-dimensional Josephson junction composed of a
spin-orbit-coupled quantum wire with an applied Zeeman field, connected between
two superconductors. Our study reveals that while spin-orbit coupling (SOC) and
a Zeeman field in the quantum wire are not sufficient to induce JDE when the
superconductors are purely singlet, the introduction of triplet pairing in the
superconductors leads to the emergence of JDE. This finding highlights the
potential of JDE as a probe for triplet superconductivity. We further
demonstrate that even in absence of SOC in the quantum wire, JDE can arise when
the directions of the triplet pairing and the Zeeman field are non-collinear,
provided the superconductors exhibit mixed singlet-triplet pairing.
Additionally, we identify specific conditions under which JDE is absent,
namely, when the pairing is purely triplet and the directions of the SOC and
the triplet pairing are perpendicular. Our findings indicate that JDE is always
accompanied by the anomalous Josephson effect. The diode effect coefficient is
found to oscillate with variations in the chemical potential of the quantum
wire, driven by Fabry-P\'erot interference effects. Our results suggest that
quantum wires in Josephson junctions could serve as effective platforms for
probing triplet superconductivity through the observation of JDE.


## Diffusion
### Masked Diffusion Models are Secretly Time-Agnostic Masked Models and Exploit Inaccurate Categorical Sampling

**Abstract**: Masked diffusion models (MDMs) have emerged as a popular research topic for
generative modeling of discrete data, thanks to their superior performance over
other discrete diffusion models, and are rivaling the auto-regressive models
(ARMs) for language modeling tasks. The recent effort in simplifying the masked
diffusion framework further leads to alignment with continuous-space diffusion
models and more principled training and sampling recipes. In this paper,
however, we reveal that both training and sampling of MDMs are theoretically
free from the time variable, arguably the key signature of diffusion models,
and are instead equivalent to masked models. The connection on the sampling
aspect is drawn by our proposed first-hitting sampler (FHS). Specifically, we
show that the FHS is theoretically equivalent to MDMs' original generation
process while significantly alleviating the time-consuming categorical sampling
and achieving a 20$\times$ speedup. In addition, our investigation challenges
previous claims that MDMs can surpass ARMs in generative perplexity. We
identify, for the first time, an underlying numerical issue, even with the
32-bit floating-point precision, which results in inaccurate categorical
sampling. We show that the numerical issue lowers the effective temperature
both theoretically and empirically, leading to unfair assessments of MDMs'
generation results in the previous literature.


### GT-CausIn: a novel causal-based insight for traffic prediction
**Authors**: Ting Gao, Rodrigo Kappes Marques, Lei Yu

**Published Date**: 2022-12-12

**PDF Url**: [2212.05782v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.05782v2)

**Abstract**: Traffic forecasting is an important application of spatiotemporal series
prediction. Among different methods, graph neural networks have achieved so far
the most promising results, learning relations between graph nodes then becomes
a crucial task. However, improvement space is very limited when these relations
are learned in a node-to-node manner. The challenge stems from (1) obscure
temporal dependencies between different stations, (2) difficulties in defining
variables beyond the node level, and (3) no ready-made method to validate the
learned relations. To confront these challenges, we define legitimate traffic
causal variables to discover the causal relation inside the traffic network,
which is carefully checked with statistic tools and case analysis. We then
present a novel model named Graph Spatial-Temporal Network Based on Causal
Insight (GT-CausIn), where prior learned causal information is integrated with
graph diffusion layers and temporal convolutional network (TCN) layers.
Experiments are carried out on two real-world traffic datasets: PEMS-BAY and
METR-LA, which show that GT-CausIn significantly outperforms the
state-of-the-art models on mid-term and long-term prediction.


### PoseTalk: Text-and-Audio-based Pose Control and Motion Refinement for One-Shot Talking Head Generation
**Authors**: Jun Ling, Yiwen Wang, Han Xue, Rong Xie, Li Song

**Published Date**: 2024-09-04

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-04

**PDF Url**: [2409.02657v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.02657v1)

**Abstract**: While previous audio-driven talking head generation (THG) methods generate
head poses from driving audio, the generated poses or lips cannot match the
audio well or are not editable. In this study, we propose \textbf{PoseTalk}, a
THG system that can freely generate lip-synchronized talking head videos with
free head poses conditioned on text prompts and audio. The core insight of our
method is using head pose to connect visual, linguistic, and audio signals.
First, we propose to generate poses from both audio and text prompts, where the
audio offers short-term variations and rhythm correspondence of the head
movements and the text prompts describe the long-term semantics of head
motions. To achieve this goal, we devise a Pose Latent Diffusion (PLD) model to
generate motion latent from text prompts and audio cues in a pose latent space.
Second, we observe a loss-imbalance problem: the loss for the lip region
contributes less than 4\% of the total reconstruction loss caused by both pose
and lip, making optimization lean towards head movements rather than lip
shapes. To address this issue, we propose a refinement-based learning strategy
to synthesize natural talking videos using two cascaded networks, i.e.,
CoarseNet, and RefineNet. The CoarseNet estimates coarse motions to produce
animated images in novel poses and the RefineNet focuses on learning finer lip
motions by progressively estimating lip motions from low-to-high resolutions,
yielding improved lip-synchronization performance. Experiments demonstrate our
pose prediction strategy achieves better pose diversity and realness compared
to text-only or audio-only, and our video generator model outperforms
state-of-the-art methods in synthesizing talking videos with natural head
motions. Project: https://junleen.github.io/projects/posetalk.


### Solving Video Inverse Problems Using Image Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: Recently, diffusion model-based inverse problem solvers (DIS) have emerged as
state-of-the-art approaches for addressing inverse problems, including image
super-resolution, deblurring, inpainting, etc. However, their application to
video inverse problems arising from spatio-temporal degradation remains largely
unexplored due to the challenges in training video diffusion models. To address
this issue, here we introduce an innovative video inverse solver that leverages
only image diffusion models. Specifically, by drawing inspiration from the
success of the recent decomposed diffusion sampler (DDS), our method treats the
time dimension of a video as the batch dimension of image diffusion models and
solves spatio-temporal optimization problems within denoised spatio-temporal
batches derived from each image diffusion model. Moreover, we introduce a
batch-consistent diffusion sampling strategy that encourages consistency across
batches by synchronizing the stochastic noise components in image diffusion
models. Our approach synergistically combines batch-consistent sampling with
simultaneous optimization of denoised spatio-temporal batches at each reverse
diffusion step, resulting in a novel and efficient diffusion sampling strategy
for video inverse problems. Experimental results demonstrate that our method
effectively addresses various spatio-temporal degradations in video inverse
problems, achieving state-of-the-art reconstructions. Project page:
