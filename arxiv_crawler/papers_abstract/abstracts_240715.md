**Abstract**: The enduring legacy of Euclidean geometry underpins classical machine
learning, which, for decades, has been primarily developed for data lying in
Euclidean space. Yet, modern machine learning increasingly encounters richly
structured data that is inherently nonEuclidean. This data can exhibit
intricate geometric, topological and algebraic structure: from the geometry of
the curvature of space-time, to topologically complex interactions between
neurons in the brain, to the algebraic transformations describing symmetries of
physical systems. Extracting knowledge from such non-Euclidean data
necessitates a broader mathematical perspective. Echoing the 19th-century
revolutions that gave rise to non-Euclidean geometry, an emerging line of
research is redefining modern machine learning with non-Euclidean structures.
Its goal: generalizing classical methods to unconventional data types with
geometry, topology, and algebra. In this review, we provide an accessible
gateway to this fast-growing field and propose a graphical taxonomy that
integrates recent advances into an intuitive unified framework. We subsequently
extract insights into current challenges and highlight exciting opportunities
for future development in this field.

**Abstract**: Antiferromagnetic spintronics offers the potential for higher-frequency
operations compared to ferromagnetic spintronics and improved insensitivity to
magnetic fields. However, previous electrical techniques to detect
antiferromagnetic dynamics have required millimeter-scale samples to achieve
measurable signals. Here we demonstrate direct electrical detection of
antiferromagnetic resonance in devices 1000 times smaller using spin-filter
tunneling in micron-scale PtTe$_2$/bilayer CrSBr/graphite junctions in which
the tunnel barrier is the van der Waals antiferromaget CrSBr. This sample
geometry allows not only efficient detection, but also electrical control of
the antiferromagnetic resonance through spin-orbit torque from the PtTe$_2$
electrode. The ability to efficiently detect and control antiferromagnetic
resonance provides the means to make detailed studies of the physics governing
these high-frequency dynamics and to pursue applications including radiation
sources, modulators, and detectors.

**Abstract**: To each complex saddle point of an action, one can attach a Lefschetz thimble
on which the imaginary part of the action is constant. Cauchy theorem states
that summation over a set of thimbles produces the exact result. This
reorganization of the path integral, is an appealing starting point for various
approximations: In the realm of auxiliary quantum Monte Carlo methods it
provides a framework to alleviate the negative sign problem. Here, we suggest
to constrain the integration to the \textit{dominant} thimbles: the thimbles
attached to the saddle points with the largest statistical weight. For the
Hubbard model, in a formulation where the the Hubbard Stratonovitch field
couples to the charge, this provides a \textit{symmetry} consistent
approximation to the physics of the Hubbard model: constraining the integration
domain does not explicitly break a symmetry. We can test this approach for the
Hubbard model at half-filling on a bipartite lattice. The paper builds on the
previously developed instanton gas approach, where an exhaustive saddle point
approximation was constructed. We present results, showing that the dominant
thimbles approximation provides results that are in remarkable agreement with
the exact results for various fermionic observables including spin and charge
order parameters and single electron spectral functions. We discuss
implications of our results for simulations away of half filling.

**Abstract**: Many microorganisms are capable of swimming through viscous fluids such as
water in order to search for nutrients, swim toward oxygen or light, or to
escape from predators. To navigate their environment they often perform large
nonreciprocal periodic deformations of their shape, by waving appendages such
as cilia or flagella, or by deforming their entire body. Even unicellular
organisms are fundamentally made of parts, which need to be cooperatively
utilized to allow these creatures to navigate their environment, without using
a centralized control mechanism. Here, we investigate the physical implications
of decentralized decision-making of the actuators of a generalized N-bead
Najafi Golestanian microswimmer, self-propelling via coordinated non-reciprocal
swimming strokes. We treat each bead as an artificial neural network-based
agent that perceives information about its neighbors and whose actions induce
strokes of its adjacent arms. With neuroevolution techniques, we evolve optimal
policies for the single-bead decision centers such that the N-bead collective
efficiently self-propels as an individual, allowing us to investigate optimal
locomotion policies for increasingly large microswimmer bodies. We demonstrate
that such decentralized policies are robust and tolerant concerning
morphological changes or defects and facilitate cargo transport or drug
delivery applications "out of the box", without further optimization. Our
approach allows us to train large swimmers ($N=100$ and more), and we show that
long-wavelength solutions lead to surprisingly efficient swimming gaits. Our
work is of relevance to understand robust locomotion of biological
microswimmers, to develop robust artificial microswimmer navigation strategies,
and, in a broader conceptional context, for Artificial Life< and in general
emergent levels of individuality.

**PDF Url**: [2407.09414v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09414v1)

**Abstract**: We outline a method of beamed power for propulsion that utilizes relativistic
electron beams. The physics of charged particle beam propagation in the space
plasma environment is discussed and the long-range (>100 A.U.) advantage of
relativistic electron beams is emphasized. A preliminary statite based beam
emitter for powering probes to ~0.1c is proposed and the challenges in
beam-power uses are explored.


### A Cordial Introduction to Double Scaled SYK

**PDF Url**: [2407.09396v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09396v1)

**Abstract**: We review recent progress regarding the double scaled Sachdev-Ye-Kitaev model
and other $p$-local quantum mechanical random Hamiltonians. These models
exhibit an expansion using chord diagrams, which can be solved by combinatorial
methods. We describe exact results in these models, including their spectrum,
correlation functions, and Lyapunov exponent. In a certain limit, these
techniques manifest the relation to the Schwarzian quantum mechanics, a theory
of quantum gravity in $AdS_2$. More generally, the theory is controlled by a
rigid algebraic structure of a quantum group, suggesting a theory of quantum
gravity on non-commutative $q$-deformed $AdS_2$. We conclude with discussion of
related universality classes, and survey some of the current research
directions.

**Abstract**: The last few years have witnessed a surge in interest and research efforts in
the field of twistronics, especially in low-angle twisted bilayers of
transition metal dichalocogenides. These novel material platforms have been
demonstrated to host periodic arrays of excitonic quantum emitters, interlayer
excitons with long lifetimes, and exotic many-body states. While much remains
to be known and understood about these heterostructures, the field of
high-angle, incommensurate bilayers is even less explored. At twist angles
larger than a few degrees, the presence of periodicity in these bilayers
becomes chaotic, making the systems essentially aperiodic and incommensurate in
nature due to the limitations of fabrication techniques. In this work, we
demonstrate the emergence of a brightened dark intralayer exciton in twisted
molybdenum diselenide homobilayer. We show that this dark exciton diffuses
across the excitation spot more efficiently as compared to trions or excitons,
reaching diffusion lengths greater than 4 microns. Temperature-dependent
spectra provide corroborative evidence and reveal a brightened dark trion. Our
results reveal some of the richness of the physics of these high-angle systems.

**Abstract**: The evolution of science education is a dynamic process driven by advances in
pedagogy, technology, and especially, our understanding of how students learn.
Educators are exploring innovative teaching and learning methodologies such as
active learning, incorporated technology, interdisciplinary approach, flipped
classrooms, personalized teaching, and many more. The goal of all these
evolving methodologies is to empower students with not only a strong foundation
in scientific knowledge but also with the skills and mindset required to thrive
in the future world. By adopting these innovative approaches, educators can
help students become effective problem solvers, critical thinkers, and life
learning citizens. Our focus is redesigning individual student learning
activities into group learning activities that will benefit various ways of
education by building each others support, connection, and communication.
Unloading individual homework and loading in-class group work during a
synchronous classroom setting will benefit all levels of learnings effectively.
Assigning most of the classwork to be completed during class time has potential
benefits since students are more likely to be engaged and focused individually
and jointly by sharing and communicating subject matter effectively. We are
discussing how to facilitate the group work effectively by creating group
assignments for personalized classrooms, setting specific rules and class
ethics to follow for the best learning practice, imposing a list of roles to
each group member, introducing a list of ground rules related to justice,
equity, and diversity inclusion (JDEI) within the group. The students
performances, progress and effectiveness are analyzed and compared.


### Loop Special Relativity: Kaluza-Klein area metric as a line element for stringy events
**Authors**: Aharon Davidson, Nadav Barkai

**Published Date**: 2024-03-18

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-12

**PDF Url**: [2403.11800v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11800v2)

**Abstract**: Let a physical event constitute a simple loop in spacetime. This in turn
calls for a generalized loop line element (= distance$^2$ between two
neighboring loops) capable of restoring, at the shrinking loop limit, the
special relativistic line element (= distance$^2$ between the two neighboring
centers-of-mass, respectively). Sticking at first stage to a flat
Euclidean/Minkowski background, one is led to such a preliminary loop line
element, where the role of coordinates is played by the oriented cross-sections
projected by the loop event. Such cross-sections are generically center-of-mass
independent, unless (owing to a topological term) the loop events are
intrinsically wrapped around a Kaluza-Klein like compact fifth dimension.
Serendipitously, it is the Kaluza-Klein ingredient which, on top of its
traditional assignments, is shown to govern the extension of Pythagoras theorem
to loop space. Associated with $M_4 \otimes S_1$ is then a 10-dim loop
spacetime metric, whose 4-dim center-of-mass core term is supplemented by a
6-dim Maxwell-style fine structure. The imperative inclusion of a positive (say
Nambu-Goto) string tension within the framework of Loop Special Relativity is
fingerprinted by a low periodicity breathing mode. Nash global isometric
embedding is conjectured to play a major role in the construction of Loop
General Relativity.


### The $Λ_c\to Λ\, l^+ν_\ell$ weak decay including new physics
**Authors**: Fernando Alvarado, Luis Alvarez-Ruso, Eliecer Hernandez, Juan Nieves, Neus Penalva

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-12

**PDF Url**: [2407.09325v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09325v1)

**Abstract**: We investigate the $\Lambda_c \to \Lambda \ell^{+} \nu_\ell$ decay with a
focus on potential new physics (NP) effects in the $\ell = \mu$ channel. We
employ an effective Hamiltonian within the framework of the Standard Model
Effective Field Theory (SMEFT) to consider generalized dimension-6 semileptonic
$c\to s$ operators of scalar, pseudoscalar, vector, axial-vector and tensor
types. We rely on Lattice QCD (LQCD) for the hadronic transition form factors,
using heavy quark spin symmetry (HQSS) to determine those that have not yet
been obtained on the lattice. Uncertainties due to the truncation of the NP
Hamiltonian and different implementations of HQSS are taken into account. As a
result, we unravel the NP discovery potential of the $\Lambda_c\to \Lambda$
semileptonic decay in different observables. Our findings indicate high
sensitivity to NP in lepton flavour universality ratios, probing multi-TeV
scales in some cases. On the theoretical side, we identify LQCD uncertainties
in axial and vector form factors as critical for improving NP sensitivity,
alongside better SMEFT uncertainty estimations.


## Diffusion
### StainFuser: Controlling Diffusion for Faster Neural Style Transfer in Multi-Gigapixel Histology Images

**PDF Url**: [2403.09302v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.09302v2)

**Abstract**: Stain normalization algorithms aim to transform the color and intensity
characteristics of a source multi-gigapixel histology image to match those of a
target image, mitigating inconsistencies in the appearance of stains used to
highlight cellular components in the images. We propose a new approach,
StainFuser, which treats this problem as a style transfer task using a novel
Conditional Latent Diffusion architecture, eliminating the need for handcrafted
color components. With this method, we curate SPI-2M the largest stain
normalization dataset to date of over 2 million histology images with neural
style transfer for high-quality transformations. Trained on this data,
StainFuser outperforms current state-of-the-art deep learning and handcrafted
methods in terms of the quality of normalized images and in terms of downstream
model performance on the CoNIC dataset.


### Any-Property-Conditional Molecule Generation with Self-Criticism using Spanning Trees

**PDF Url**: [2407.09357v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.09357v1)

**Abstract**: Generating novel molecules is challenging, with most representations leading
to generative models producing many invalid molecules. Spanning Tree-based
Graph Generation (STGG) is a promising approach to ensure the generation of
valid molecules, outperforming state-of-the-art SMILES and graph diffusion
models for unconditional generation. In the real world, we want to be able to
generate molecules conditional on one or multiple desired properties rather
than unconditionally. Thus, in this work, we extend STGG to
multi-property-conditional generation. Our approach, STGG+, incorporates a
modern Transformer architecture, random masking of properties during training
(enabling conditioning on any subset of properties and classifier-free
guidance), an auxiliary property-prediction loss (allowing the model to
self-criticize molecules and select the best ones), and other improvements. We
show that STGG+ achieves state-of-the-art performance on in-distribution and
out-of-distribution conditional generation, and reward maximization.


### OneActor: Consistent Character Generation via Cluster-Conditioned Guidance

**Abstract**: Text-to-image diffusion models benefit artists with high-quality image
generation. Yet their stochastic nature hinders artists from creating
consistent images of the same subject. Existing methods try to tackle this
challenge and generate consistent content in various ways. However, they either
depend on external restricted data or require expensive tuning of the diffusion
model. For this issue, we propose a novel one-shot tuning paradigm, termed as
OneActor. It efficiently performs consistent subject generation solely driven
by prompts via a learned semantic guidance to bypass the laborious backbone
tuning. We lead the way to formalize the objective of consistent subject
generation from a clustering perspective, and thus design a cluster-conditioned
model. To mitigate the overfitting challenge shared by one-shot tuning
pipelines, we augment the tuning with auxiliary samples and devise two
inference strategies: semantic interpolation and cluster guidance. These
techniques are later verified to significantly enhance the generation quality.
Comprehensive experiments show that our method outperforms a variety of
baselines with satisfactory subject consistency, superior prompt conformity as
well as high image quality. Our method is capable of multi-subject generation
and compatible with popular diffusion extensions. Besides, we achieve a 4 times
faster tuning speed than tuning-based baselines and, if desired, avoid
increasing inference time. Furthermore, to our best knowledge, we are the first
to prove that the semantic space of the diffusion model has the same
interpolation property as the latent space does. This property can serve as
another promising tool for fine generation control.

**Abstract**: In recent years, the diagnosis of gliomas has become increasingly complex.
Analysis of glioma histopathology images using artificial intelligence (AI)
offers new opportunities to support diagnosis and outcome prediction. To give
an overview of the current state of research, this review examines 83 publicly
available research studies that have proposed AI-based methods for whole-slide
histopathology images of human gliomas, covering the diagnostic tasks of
subtyping (23/83), grading (27/83), molecular marker prediction (20/83), and
survival prediction (29/83). All studies were reviewed with regard to
methodological aspects as well as clinical applicability. It was found that the
focus of current research is the assessment of hematoxylin and eosin-stained
tissue sections of adult-type diffuse gliomas. The majority of studies (52/83)
are based on the publicly available glioblastoma and low-grade glioma datasets
from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and only a few studies employed other
datasets in isolation (16/83) or in addition to the TCGA datasets (15/83).
Current approaches mostly rely on convolutional neural networks (63/83) for
analyzing tissue at 20x magnification (35/83). A new field of research is the
integration of clinical data, omics data, or magnetic resonance imaging
(29/83). So far, AI-based methods have achieved promising results, but are not
yet used in real clinical settings. Future work should focus on the independent
validation of methods on larger, multi-site datasets with high-quality and
up-to-date clinical and molecular pathology annotations to demonstrate routine
applicability.
