**Abstract**: In this study, we investigate the signatures of a non-commutative black hole
solution. Initially, we calculate the thermodynamic properties of the system,
including entropy, heat capacity, and Hawking radiation. For the latter
quantity, we employ two distinct methods: surface gravity and the topological
approach. Additionally, we examine the emission rate and remnant mass within
this context. Remarkably, the lifetime of the black hole, after reaching its
final state due to the evaporation process, is expressed analytically up to a
grey-body factor. We estimate the lifetime for specific initial and final mass
configurations. Also, we analyze the tensorial quasinormal modes using the
6th-order WKB method. Finally, we study the deflection angle, i.e.,
gravitational lensing, in both the weak and strong deflection limits.

**Abstract**: Enabling Large Language Models (LLMs) to comprehend the 3D physical world
remains a significant challenge. Due to the lack of large-scale 3D-text pair
datasets, the success of LLMs has yet to be replicated in 3D understanding. In
this paper, we rethink this issue and propose a new task: 3D Data-Efficient
Point-Language Understanding. The goal is to enable LLMs to achieve robust 3D
object understanding with minimal 3D point cloud and text data pairs. To
address this task, we introduce GreenPLM, which leverages more text data to
compensate for the lack of 3D data. First, inspired by using CLIP to align
images and text, we utilize a pre-trained point cloud-text encoder to map the
3D point cloud space to the text space. This mapping leaves us to seamlessly
connect the text space with LLMs. Once the point-text-LLM connection is
established, we further enhance text-LLM alignment by expanding the
intermediate text space, thereby reducing the reliance on 3D point cloud data.
Specifically, we generate 6M free-text descriptions of 3D objects, and design a
three-stage training strategy to help LLMs better explore the intrinsic
connections between different modalities. To achieve efficient modality
alignment, we design a zero-parameter cross-attention module for token pooling.
Extensive experimental results show that GreenPLM requires only 12% of the 3D
training data used by existing state-of-the-art models to achieve superior 3D
understanding. Remarkably, GreenPLM also achieves competitive performance using
text-only data. The code and weights are available at:

**Abstract**: Rydberg atom array has been established as one appealing platform for quantum
simulation and quantum computation. Recent experimental development of trapping
and controlling two-species atoms using optical tweezer arrays has brought more
complex interactions in this game, enabling much versatile novel quantum states
and phenomena to emerge and thus leading to a growing need for both theoretical
and numerical investigations in this regard. In this paper we systematically
calculate the ground state phase diagram of alternating two-species atom array
and find some novel quantum states that cannot exist in traditional cold-atom
platforms, for instance the period $4$ product state $|1100\rangle^{\otimes
m}$, the period $6$ product state $|111000\rangle^{\otimes m}$ and
order-disorder separation phase. We also confirm the existence of floating
phase, however, in this system it has to be described by two interacting
bosonic fields whereas that in the single species Rydberg atom array can be
understood as free bosons. More interestingly, in the quench dynamics we
discover a type of new quantum many-body scar distinct from that previous found
in single species atoms which is explained by low-energy effective theory of
the PXP model. Instead, the underlying physics of the newly found quantum
many-body scar can be described by a perturbation theory spanning the whole
energy spectrum. Detailed analysis on how to experimentally prepare these
states and observe the phenomena is provided. Numerical evidence shows that the
proposed scheme is robust against typical experimentally relevent imperfections
and thus it is implementable. Our work opens new avenue for quantum simulating
novel quantum many-body states both in and out of equilibrium arising from the
interplay of competing interactions of different atom species and quantum
fluctuations.


### A Physics Preserving Neural Network Based Approach for Constitutive Modeling of Isotropic Fibrous Materials
**Authors**: Nishan Parvez, Jacob S. Merson

**Published Date**: 2024-03-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-28

**PDF Url**: [2403.13357v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13357v4)

**Abstract**: We develop a new neural network architecture that strictly enforces
constitutive constraints such as polyconvexity, frame-indifference, and the
symmetry of the stress and material stiffness. Additionally, we show that the
accuracy of the stress and material stiffness predictions is significantly
improved for this neural network by using a Sobolev minimization strategy that
includes derivative terms. Using our neural network, we model the constitutive
behavior of fibrous-type discrete network material. With Sobolev minimization,
we obtain a normalized mean square error of 0.15% for the strain energy
density, 0.815% averaged across the components of the stress, and 5.4% averaged
across the components of the stiffness tensor. This machine-learned
constitutive model was deployed in a finite element simulation of a facet
capsular ligament. The displacement fields and stress-strain curves were
compared to a multiscale simulation that required running on a GPU-based
supercomputer. The new approach maintained upward of 85% accuracy in stress up
to 70% strain while reducing the computation cost by orders of magnitude.

**Abstract**: Time-of-flight measurements of high-energy astrophysical neutrinos can be
used to probe Lorentz invariance, a pillar of modern physics. If
Lorentz-invariance violation (LIV) occurs, it could cause neutrinos to slow
down, with the delay scaling linearly or quadratically with their energy. We
introduce non-parametric statistical methods designed to detect LIV-induced
distortions in the temporal structure of a high-energy neutrino flare as it
travels to Earth from a distant astrophysical source, independently of the
intrinsic timing properties of the source. Our approach, illustrated using the
2014/2015 TeV-PeV neutrino flare from the blazar TXS 0506+056 detected by
IceCube, finds that the LIV energy scale must exceed 10^{14} GeV (linear) or
10^9 GeV (quadratic). Our methods provide a robust means to investigate LIV by
focusing solely on a neutrino flare, without relying on electromagnetic
counterparts, and account for realistic energy and directional uncertainties.
For completeness, we compare our limits inferred from TXS 0506+056 to the
sensitivity inferred from multi-messenger detection of tentative coincidences
between neutrinos and electromagnetic emission from active galactic nuclei and
tidal disruption events.

**PDF Url**: [2404.12660v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12660v3)

**Abstract**: A search for the non-resonant production of Higgs boson pairs in the
$HH\rightarrow b\bar{b}\tau^+\tau^-$ channel is performed using 140 fb$^{-1}$
of proton-proton collisions at a centre-of-mass energy of $13$ TeV recorded by
the ATLAS detector at the CERN Large Hadron Collider. The analysis strategy is
optimised to probe anomalous values of the Higgs boson self-coupling modifier
$\kappa_\lambda$ and of the quartic $HHVV$ ($V = W,Z$) coupling modifier
$\kappa_{2V}$. No significant excess above the expected background from
Standard Model processes is observed. An observed (expected) upper limit
$\mu_{HH}<5.9$ $(3.3)$ is set at 95% confidence-level on the Higgs boson pair
production cross-section normalised to its Standard Model prediction. The
coupling modifiers are constrained to an observed (expected) 95% confidence
interval of $-3.1 < \kappa_\lambda < 9.0$ ($-2.5 < \kappa_\lambda < 9.3$) and
$-0.5 < \kappa_{2V} < 2.7$ ($-0.2 < \kappa_{2V} < 2.4$), assuming all other
Higgs boson couplings are fixed to the Standard Model prediction. The results
are also interpreted in the context of effective field theories via constraints
on anomalous Higgs boson couplings and Higgs boson pair production
cross-sections assuming different kinematic benchmark scenarios.

**Abstract**: Quantum sensors promise revolutionary advances in medical imaging, energy
production, mass detection, geodesy, foundational physics research, and a host
of other fields. In many sensors, the signal takes the form of a changing qubit
frequency, which is detected with an interference measurement. Unfortunately,
environmental noise decoheres the qubit state, reducing signal-to-noise ratio
(SNR). Here we introduce a protocol for enhancing the sensitivity of a
measurement of a qubit's frequency in the presence of decoherence. We use a
continuous drive to stabilize one component of the qubit's Bloch vector,
enhancing the effect of a small static frequency shift. We demonstrate our
protocol on a superconducting qubit, enhancing SNR per measurement shot by
1.65$\times$ and SNR per qubit evolution time by 1.09$\times$ compared to
standard Ramsey interferometry. We explore the protocol theoretically and
numerically, finding maximum enhancements of 1.96$\times$ and 1.18$\times$,
respectively. We also show that the protocol is robust to parameter
miscalibrations. Our protocol provides an unconditional enhancement in
signal-to-noise ratio compared to standard Ramsey interferometry. It requires
no feedback and no extra control or measurement resources, and can be
immediately applied in a wide variety of quantum computing and quantum sensor
technologies to enhance their sensitivities.


### asimulation: Domain formation and impact on observables in resolved cosmological simulations of the (a)symmetron
**Authors**: Øyvind Christiansen, Farbod Hassani, David F. Mota

**Published Date**: 2024-01-04

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-28

**PDF Url**: [2401.02410v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.02410v2)

**Abstract**: The symmetron is a dark energy and dark matter candidate that forms
topological defects in the late-time universe and holds the promise of
resolving some of the cosmological tensions. We performed high-resolution
simulations of the dynamical and non-linear (a)symmetron using the recently
developed relativistic N-body code asevolution. By extensively testing the
temporal and spatial convergence of domain decompositioning and domain wall
stability, we determined criteria and physical intuition for the convergence.
We applied the resolution criteria to run five high-resolution simulations with
1280^3 grids and a box size of 500 Mpc/h of the (a)symmetron. We considered the
behaviour of the scalar field and the domain walls in each scenario. We find
the effect on the matter power spectra, the HMFs, and observables computed over
the past light cone of an observer, such as the integrated Sachs-Wolfe and
non-linear Rees-Sciama effect and the lensing, compared to LCDM. We show local
oscillations of the fifth force strength and the formation of planar structures
in the density field. The dynamics of the field was visualised in animations
with high resolution in time. The simulation code is made publicly available.


### Hybrid Type-II and Type-III seesaw model for the muon $g-2$ anomaly
**Authors**: Lei Cai, Chengcheng Han, Shi-Ping He, Peiwen Wu

**Published Date**: 2024-08-28

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-28

**PDF Url**: [2408.15910v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15910v1)

**Abstract**: In this work, we investigate the muon anomalous dipole moment $a_\mu$ in a
model that extends the Standard Model with a scalar triplet and a vector-like
lepton triplet. Different from previous studies, we find that there is still
viable parameter space in this model to explain the discrepancy $\Delta
a_\mu=a_{\mu}(\mathrm{Exp})-a_{\mu}(\mathrm{SM})$. While being consistent with
the current data of neutrino mass, precision electroweak measurements and the
perturbativity of couplings, our model can provide new physics contribution
$a_\mu^\textrm{NP}$ to cover the central region of $\Delta a_\mu$ with new
scalar and fermion mass as low as around TeV. This mass scale is allowed by the
current collider searches for doubly charged scalars and vector-like leptons,
and they can be tested at future high energy and/or high luminosity colliders.


### Differential cross-section measurements of the production of four charged leptons in association with two jets using the ATLAS detector
**Authors**: ATLAS Collaboration

**PDF Url**: [2308.12324v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.12324v2)

**Abstract**: Differential cross-sections are measured for the production of four charged
leptons in association with two jets. These measurements are sensitive to final
states in which the jets are produced via the strong interaction as well as to
the purely-electroweak vector boson scattering process. The analysis is
performed using proton-proton collision data collected by ATLAS at
$\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV and with an integrated luminosity of 140 fb$^{-1}$. The data
are corrected for the effects of detector inefficiency and resolution and are
compared to state-of-the-art Monte Carlo event generator predictions. The
differential cross-sections are used to search for anomalous weak-boson
self-interactions that are induced by dimension-six and dimension-eight
operators in Standard Model effective field theory.


## Diffusion
### Airfoil Diffusion: Denoising Diffusion Model For Conditional Airfoil Generation
**Authors**: Reid Graves, Amir Barati Farimani

**Published Date**: 2024-08-28

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-28

**PDF Url**: [2408.15898v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15898v1)

**Abstract**: The design of aerodynamic shapes, such as airfoils, has traditionally
required significant computational resources and relied on predefined design
parameters, which limit the potential for novel shape synthesis. In this work,
we introduce a data-driven methodology for airfoil generation using a diffusion
model. Trained on a dataset of preexisting airfoils, our model can generate an
arbitrary number of new airfoils from random vectors, which can be conditioned
on specific aerodynamic performance metrics such as lift and drag, or geometric
criteria. Our results demonstrate that the diffusion model effectively produces
airfoil shapes with realistic aerodynamic properties, offering substantial
improvements in efficiency, flexibility, and the potential for discovering
innovative airfoil designs. This approach significantly expands the design
space, facilitating the synthesis of high-performance aerodynamic shapes that
transcend the limitations of traditional methods.


### GenDDS: Generating Diverse Driving Video Scenarios with Prompt-to-Video Generative Model
**Authors**: Yongjie Fu, Yunlong Li, Xuan Di

**Published Date**: 2024-08-28

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-28

**PDF Url**: [2408.15868v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15868v1)

**Abstract**: Autonomous driving training requires a diverse range of datasets encompassing
various traffic conditions, weather scenarios, and road types. Traditional data
augmentation methods often struggle to generate datasets that represent rare
occurrences. To address this challenge, we propose GenDDS, a novel approach for
generating driving scenarios generation by leveraging the capabilities of
Stable Diffusion XL (SDXL), an advanced latent diffusion model. Our methodology
involves the use of descriptive prompts to guide the synthesis process, aimed
at producing realistic and diverse driving scenarios. With the power of the
latest computer vision techniques, such as ControlNet and Hotshot-XL, we have
built a complete pipeline for video generation together with SDXL. We employ
the KITTI dataset, which includes real-world driving videos, to train the
model. Through a series of experiments, we demonstrate that our model can
generate high-quality driving videos that closely replicate the complexity and
variability of real-world driving scenarios. This research contributes to the
development of sophisticated training data for autonomous driving systems and
opens new avenues for creating virtual environments for simulation and
validation purposes.


### FADE: Towards Fairness-aware Augmentation for Domain Generalization via Classifier-Guided Score-based Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Yujie Lin, Dong Li, Chen Zhao, Minglai Shao

**Published Date**: 2024-06-13

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-28

**PDF Url**: [2406.09495v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.09495v2)

**Abstract**: Fairness-aware domain generalization (FairDG) has emerged as a critical
challenge for deploying trustworthy AI systems, particularly in scenarios
involving distribution shifts. Traditional methods for addressing fairness have
failed in domain generalization due to their lack of consideration for
distribution shifts. Although disentanglement has been used to tackle FairDG,
it is limited by its strong assumptions. To overcome these limitations, we
propose Fairness-aware Classifier-Guided Score-based Diffusion Models (FADE) as
a novel approach to effectively address the FairDG issue. Specifically, we
first pre-train a score-based diffusion model (SDM) and two classifiers to
equip the model with strong generalization capabilities across different
domains. Then, we guide the SDM using these pre-trained classifiers to
effectively eliminate sensitive information from the generated data. Finally,
the generated fair data is used to train downstream classifiers, ensuring
robust performance under new data distributions. Extensive experiments on three
real-world datasets demonstrate that FADE not only enhances fairness but also
improves accuracy in the presence of distribution shifts. Additionally, FADE
outperforms existing methods in achieving the best accuracy-fairness
trade-offs.


### Grand canonical generative diffusion model for crystalline phases and grain boundaries
**Authors**: Bo Lei, Enze Chen, Hyuna Kwon, Tim Hsu, Babak Sadigh, Vincenzo Lordi, Timofey Frolov, Fei Zhou

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-28

**PDF Url**: [2408.15601v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15601v1)

**Abstract**: The diffusion model has emerged as a powerful tool for generating atomic
structures for materials science. This work calls attention to the deficiency
of current particle-based diffusion models, which represent atoms as a point
cloud, in generating even the simplest ordered crystalline structures. The
problem is attributed to particles being trapped in local minima during the
score-driven simulated annealing of the diffusion process, similar to the
physical process of force-driven simulated annealing. We develop a solution,
the grand canonical diffusion model, which adopts an alternative voxel-based
representation with continuous rather than fixed number of particles. The
method is applied towards generation of several common crystalline phases as
well as the technologically important and challenging problem of grain boundary
structures.


### MODULI: Unlocking Preference Generalization via Diffusion Models for Offline Multi-Objective Reinforcement Learning
**Authors**: Yifu Yuan, Zhenrui Zheng, Zibin Dong, Jianye Hao

**Published Date**: 2024-08-28

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-28

**PDF Url**: [2408.15501v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.15501v1)

**Abstract**: Multi-objective Reinforcement Learning (MORL) seeks to develop policies that
simultaneously optimize multiple conflicting objectives, but it requires
extensive online interactions. Offline MORL provides a promising solution by
training on pre-collected datasets to generalize to any preference upon
deployment. However, real-world offline datasets are often conservatively and
narrowly distributed, failing to comprehensively cover preferences, leading to
the emergence of out-of-distribution (OOD) preference areas. Existing offline
MORL algorithms exhibit poor generalization to OOD preferences, resulting in
policies that do not align with preferences. Leveraging the excellent
expressive and generalization capabilities of diffusion models, we propose
MODULI (Multi-objective Diffusion Planner with Sliding Guidance), which employs
a preference-conditioned diffusion model as a planner to generate trajectories
that align with various preferences and derive action for decision-making. To
achieve accurate generation, MODULI introduces two return normalization methods
under diverse preferences for refining guidance. To further enhance
generalization to OOD preferences, MODULI proposes a novel sliding guidance
mechanism, which involves training an additional slider adapter to capture the
direction of preference changes. Incorporating the slider, it transitions from
in-distribution (ID) preferences to generating OOD preferences, patching, and
extending the incomplete Pareto front. Extensive experiments on the D4MORL
benchmark demonstrate that our algorithm outperforms state-of-the-art Offline
MORL baselines, exhibiting excellent generalization to OOD preferences.


## Quantitative Finance
### Weak error estimates for rough volatility models
**Authors**: Peter K. Friz, William Salkeld, Thomas Wagenhofer

**Published Date**: 2022-12-03

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-28

**PDF Url**: [2212.01591v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2212.01591v2)

**Abstract**: We consider a class of stochastic processes with rough stochastic volatility,
examples of which include the rough Bergomi and rough Stein-Stein model, that
have gained considerable importance in quantitative finance.
  A basic question for such (non-Markovian) models concerns efficient numerical
schemes. While strong rates are well understood (order $H$), we tackle here the
intricate question of weak rates. Our main result asserts that the weak rate,
for a reasonably large class of test function, is essentially of order $\min \{
3H+\tfrac12, 1 \}$ where $H \in (0,1/2]$ is the Hurst parameter of the
fractional Brownian motion that underlies the rough volatility process.
  Interestingly, the phase transition at $H=1/6$ is related to the correlation
between the two driving factors, and thus gives additional meaning to a
quantity already of central importance in stochastic volatility modelling.Our
results are complemented by a lower bound which show that the obtained weak
rate is indeed optimal.
