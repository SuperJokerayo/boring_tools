**Abstract**: Symmetry resolved entanglement and entanglement asymmetry are two measures of
quantum correlations sensitive to symmetries of the system. Here we discuss
their non-equilibrium dynamics in the Rule 54 cellular automaton, a simple, yet
interacting, integrable model. Both quantities can be expressed in terms of the
more analytically tractable "charged moments", i.e. traces of powers of a
suitably deformed density matrix, via a replica trick. We express them in terms
of a tensor network, which we contract in space using a system of local
algebraic relations. This gives the asymptotic form for the charged moments,
valid in the regime of large but finite time that is shorter than all the
relevant subsystem sizes. In this regime the charge moments decay exponentially
with the rate given by the leading solution to a cubic equation.

**Abstract**: The p-wave Cooper-pairing instability in superfluid $^{3}$He, characterized
by a parity-breaking excitation gap, is regarded as one of the most rich and
complex phenomena in physics. The possibility of a counterpart unconventional
p-wave ordering of interacting fermions, in which a Fermi surface spontaneously
breaks the parity symmetry, has been an open problem for many decades. Here we
identify the realization of the counterpart of p-wave superfluidity in
magnetism. We demonstrate a strong parity-breaking and anisotropic symmetry
lowering of spin-polarized and time-reversal symmetric Fermi surfaces in a
representative p-wave magnet CeNiAsO. As a direct experimental signature we
predict a large spontaneous anisotropy of the resistivity. Abundant and robust
realizations of the unconventional p-wave magnetism can be identified from
suitable non-relativistic crystal-lattice and spin symmetries, without
requiring strong correlations and extreme external conditions. This opens new
prospects in fields ranging from topological phenomena to spintronics.

**Abstract**: Resampling is a common technique applied in digital signal processing. Based
on the Fast Fourier Transformation (FFT), we apply an optimization called here
the LMN method to achieve fast and robust re-sampling. In addition to
performance comparisons with some other popular methods, we illustrate the
effectiveness of this LMN method in a particle physics experiment: re-sampling
of waveforms from Liquid Argon Time Projection Chambers.

**Abstract**: Quantum information processing and computing tasks can be understood as
quantum networks, comprising quantum states and channels and possible physical
transformations on them. It is hence pertinent to estimate the change in
informational content of quantum processes due to physical transformations they
undergo. The physical transformations of quantum states are described by
quantum channels, while the transformations of quantum channels are described
by quantum superchannels. In this work, we determine fundamental limitations on
how well the physical transformation on quantum channels can be undone or
reversed, which are of crucial interest to design and benchmark quantum
information and computation devices. In particular, we refine (strengthen) the
quantum data processing inequality for quantum channels under the action of
quantum superchannels. We identify a class of quantum superchannels, which
appears to be the superchannel analogue of subunital quantum channels, under
the action of which the entropy of an arbitrary quantum channel is
nondecreasing. We also provide a refined inequality for the entropy change of
quantum channels under the action of an arbitrary quantum superchannel.

**Abstract**: Density functional theory has become the workhorse of quantum physics,
chemistry, and materials science. Within these fields, a broad range of
applications needs to be covered. These applications range from solids to
molecular systems, from organic to inorganic chemistry, or even from electrons
to other fermions such as protons or muons. This is emphasized by the plethora
of density functional approximations that have been developed for various
cases. In this work, a new local hybrid exchange-correlation density functional
is constructed from first principles, promoting generality and transferability.
We show that constraint satisfaction can be achieved even for admixtures with
full exact exchange, without sacrificing accuracy. The performance of the new
functional for electronic structure theory is assessed for thermochemical
properties, excitation energies, M\"ossbauer isomer shifts, NMR spin-spin
coupling constants, NMR shieldings and shifts, magnetizabilities, EPR hyperfine
coupling constants, and EPR g-tensors. The new density functional shows a
robust performance throughout all tests and is numerically robust only
requiring small grids for converged results. Additionally, the functional can
be easily generalized to arbitrary fermions as shown for electron-proton
correlation energies. Therefore, we outline that density functionals generated
in this way are general purpose tools for quantum mechanical studies.

**Abstract**: Quantum telepathy, or pseudotelepathy, is the phenomenon where two
non-communicating parties can exhibit correlated behaviors that are impossible
to achieve using classical mechanics. This is also known as Bell inequality
violation and is made possible by quantum entanglement. In this work, we
present a conceptual framework for applying quantum telepathy to real-world
problems. In general, the problems involve coordinating decisions given a set
of observations without being able to communicate. We argue this inability is
actually quite prevalent in the modern era where the decision-making timescales
of computer processors are so short that speed of light delay is actually quite
appreciable in comparison. We highlight the example of high-frequency trading
(HFT), where trades are made at microsecond timescales, but the speed of light
delay between different exchanges can range from the order of 10 microseconds
to 10 milliseconds. Due to the maturity of Bell inequality violation
experiments, experimental realization of quantum telepathy schemes that can
attain a quantum advantage for real-world problems $\textit{is already almost
immediately possible}$. We demonstrate this by conducting a case study for a
concrete HFT scenario that gives rise to a generalization of the CHSH game and
evaluate different possible physical implementations for achieving a quantum
advantage. It is well known that Bell inequality violation is a rigorous
mathematical proof of a quantum advantage over any classical strategy and does
not need any complexity-theoretic assumptions such as
$\text{BQP}\neq\text{BPP}$. Moreover, fault tolerance is not necessary to
realize a quantum advantage: for example, violating the CHSH inequality only
requires single-qubit gates applied on two entangled qubits.

**Abstract**: The deployment of artificial intelligence (AI) applications has accelerated
rapidly. AI enabled technologies are facing the public in many ways including
infrastructure, consumer products and home applications. Because many of these
technologies present risks either in the form of physical injury, or bias,
potentially yielding unfair outcomes, policy makers must consider the need for
oversight. Most policymakers, however, lack the technical knowledge to judge
whether an emerging AI technology is safe, effective, and requires oversight,
therefore policy makers must depend on expert opinion. But policymakers are
better served when, in addition to expert opinion, they have some general
understanding of existing guidelines and regulations. This work provides an
overview [the landscape] of AI legislation and directives at the international,
U.S. state, city and federal levels. It also reviews relevant business
standards, and technical society initiatives. Then an overlap and gap analysis
are performed resulting in a reference guide that includes recommendations and
guidance for future policy making.

**Abstract**: An environment interacting with a quantum system can enhance transport
through the suppression of quantum effects responsible for localization. In
this paper, we study the interplay between bulk dephasing and a linear
potential in a boundary-driven tight-binding chain. A linear potential induces
Wannier-Stark localization in the absence of noise, while dephasing induces
diffusive transport in the absence of a tilt. We derive an approximate
expression for the steady-state current as a function of both dephasing and
tilt which closely matches the exact solution for a wide range of parameters.
From it, we find that the maximum current occurs for a dephasing rate equal to
the period of Bloch oscillations in the Wannier-Stark localized system. We also
find that the current displays a maximum as a function of the system size,
provided that the total potential tilt across the chain remains constant. Our
results can be verified in current experimental platforms and represents a step
forward in analytical studies of environment-assisted transport.

**Abstract**: With the growing prevalence of AI, demand increases for efficient machine
learning hardware. Physical systems are sought which combine image feature
detection with the essential nonlinearity for tasks such as image
classification. Existing physical hardware typically detects features linearly,
then employs digital processing for nonlinear activation. Biological vision
systems excel at nonlinear image processing. The retina detects features in
ganglion cells via lateral inhibition, where neighbouring cells nonlinearly
compete for activation.
  We present a bio-inspired 'retinomorphic' machine vision platform using an
on-chip semiconductor network laser. The system detects multiple features in
parallel via spatially-overlapping lasing modes, with integrated nonlinearity
provided by antagonistic gain competition between modes - a photonic analogue
of retinal inhibition. Parallel feature-detection enhances efficiency relative
to feature-detection schemes which operate sequentially or via multiple device
copies, with Si-compatible processing and a compact micron-scale footprint
relative to existing mm-scale systems. We report 98.05% accuracy on
MNIST-digits and 87.85% on Fashion-MNIST, with strong performance on short
training datasets.

**Abstract**: Kramers-Kronig relations link the real and imaginary part of the Fourier
transform of a well-behaved causal transfer function describing a linear,
time-invariant system. From the physical point of view, according to the
Kramers-Kronig relations, absorption and dispersion become two sides of the
same coin. Due to the simplicity of the assumptions underlying them, the
relations are a cornerstone of physics. The rigorous mathematical proof was
carried out by Titchmarsh in 1937 and just requires the transfer function to be
square-integrable ($L^2$), or equivalently that the impulse response of the
system at hand has a finite energy. Titchmarsh's proof is definitely not easy,
thus leading to crucial steps that are often overlooked by instructors and,
occasionally, prompting some authors to attempt shaky shortcuts. Here we share
a rigorous mathematical proof that relies on the Laplace formalism and requires
a slightly stronger assumption on the transfer function, namely its being
Lebesgue-integrable ($L^1$). While the result is not as general as Titchmarsh's
proof, its enhanced simplicity makes a deeper knowledge of the mathematical
aspects of the Kramers-Kronig relations more accessible to the audience of
physicists.


## Diffusion
### Noise Level Adaptive Diffusion Model for Robust Reconstruction of Accelerated MRI

**Abstract**: In general, diffusion model-based MRI reconstruction methods incrementally
remove artificially added noise while imposing data consistency to reconstruct
the underlying images. However, real-world MRI acquisitions already contain
inherent noise due to thermal fluctuations. This phenomenon is particularly
notable when using ultra-fast, high-resolution imaging sequences for advanced
research, or using low-field systems favored by low- and middle-income
countries. These common scenarios can lead to sub-optimal performance or
complete failure of existing diffusion model-based reconstruction techniques.
Specifically, as the artificially added noise is gradually removed, the
inherent MRI noise becomes increasingly pronounced, making the actual noise
level inconsistent with the predefined denoising schedule and consequently
inaccurate image reconstruction. To tackle this problem, we propose a posterior
sampling strategy with a novel NoIse Level Adaptive Data Consistency (Nila-DC)
operation. Extensive experiments are conducted on two public datasets and an
in-house clinical dataset with field strength ranging from 0.3T to 3T, showing
that our method surpasses the state-of-the-art MRI reconstruction methods, and
is highly robust against various noise levels. The code for Nila is available
at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/Nila.


### Robust Simultaneous Multislice MRI Reconstruction Using Deep Generative Priors

**Abstract**: Simultaneous multislice (SMS) imaging is a powerful technique for
accelerating magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) acquisitions. However, SMS
reconstruction remains challenging due to the complex signal interactions
between and within the excited slices. This study presents a robust SMS MRI
reconstruction method using deep generative priors. Starting from Gaussian
noise, we leverage denoising diffusion probabilistic models (DDPM) to gradually
recover the individual slices through reverse diffusion iterations while
imposing data consistency from the measured k-space under readout concatenation
framework. The posterior sampling procedure is designed such that the DDPM
training can be performed on single-slice images without special adjustments
for SMS tasks. Additionally, our method integrates a low-frequency enhancement
(LFE) module to address a practical issue that SMS-accelerated fast spin echo
(FSE) and echo-planar imaging (EPI) sequences cannot easily embed
autocalibration signals. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our approach
consistently outperforms existing methods and generalizes well to unseen
datasets. The code is available at https://github.com/Solor-pikachu/ROGER after
the review process.

**Abstract**: Echocardiography video is a primary modality for diagnosing heart diseases,
but the limited data poses challenges for both clinical teaching and machine
learning training. Recently, video generative models have emerged as a
promising strategy to alleviate this issue. However, previous methods often
relied on holistic conditions during generation, hindering the flexible
movement control over specific cardiac structures. In this context, we propose
an explainable and controllable method for echocardiography video generation,
taking an initial frame and a motion curve as guidance. Our contributions are
three-fold. First, we extract motion information from each heart substructure
to construct motion curves, enabling the diffusion model to synthesize
customized echocardiography videos by modifying these curves. Second, we
propose the structure-to-motion alignment module, which can map semantic
features onto motion curves across cardiac structures. Third, The
position-aware attention mechanism is designed to enhance video consistency
utilizing Gaussian masks with structural position information. Extensive
experiments on three echocardiography datasets show that our method outperforms
others regarding fidelity and consistency. The full code will be released at
https://github.com/mlmi-2024-72/ECM.

**Abstract**: Incorporating a temporal dimension into pretrained image diffusion models for
video generation is a prevalent approach. However, this method is
computationally demanding and necessitates large-scale video datasets. More
critically, the heterogeneity between image and video datasets often results in
catastrophic forgetting of the image expertise. Recent attempts to directly
extract video snippets from image diffusion models have somewhat mitigated
these problems. Nevertheless, these methods can only generate brief video clips
with simple movements and fail to capture fine-grained motion or non-grid
deformation. In this paper, we propose a novel Zero-Shot video Sampling
algorithm, denoted as $\mathcal{ZS}^2$, capable of directly sampling
high-quality video clips from existing image synthesis methods, such as Stable
Diffusion, without any training or optimization. Specifically, $\mathcal{ZS}^2$
utilizes the dependency noise model and temporal momentum attention to ensure
content consistency and animation coherence, respectively. This ability enables
it to excel in related tasks, such as conditional and context-specialized video
generation and instruction-guided video editing. Experimental results
demonstrate that $\mathcal{ZS}^2$ achieves state-of-the-art performance in
zero-shot video generation, occasionally outperforming recent supervised
methods.

### Transient anisotropic kernel for probabilistic learning on manifolds
**Authors**: Christian Soize, Roger Ghanem

**Abstract**: PLoM (Probabilistic Learning on Manifolds) is a method introduced in 2016 for
handling small training datasets by projecting an It\^o equation from a
stochastic dissipative Hamiltonian dynamical system, acting as the MCMC
generator, for which the KDE-estimated probability measure with the training
dataset is the invariant measure. PLoM performs a projection on a reduced-order
vector basis related to the training dataset, using the diffusion maps (DMAPS)
basis constructed with a time-independent isotropic kernel. In this paper, we
propose a new ISDE projection vector basis built from a transient anisotropic
kernel, providing an alternative to the DMAPS basis to improve statistical
surrogates for stochastic manifolds with heterogeneous data. The construction
ensures that for times near the initial time, the DMAPS basis coincides with
the transient basis. For larger times, the differences between the two bases
are characterized by the angle of their spanned vector subspaces. The optimal
instant yielding the optimal transient basis is determined using an estimation
of mutual information from Information Theory, which is normalized by the
entropy estimation to account for the effects of the number of realizations
used in the estimations. Consequently, this new vector basis better represents
statistical dependencies in the learned probability measure for any dimension.
Three applications with varying levels of statistical complexity and data
heterogeneity validate the proposed theory, showing that the transient
anisotropic kernel improves the learned probability measure.
