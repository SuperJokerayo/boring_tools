**Abstract**: The expected improvements in the precision of inflationary physics
observables including the scalar spectral index $n_{s}$ and the
tensor-to-scalar ratio $r$ will reveal more than just the viability of a
particular model of inflation. In the presence of a curvaton field $\chi$,
supposedly dead models of inflation can be resurrected as these observables are
affected by curvaton perturbations. For currently successful models, improved
constraints will enable us to constrain the properties of extra decaying scalar
degrees of freedom produced during inflation. In this work, we demonstrate
these diverse uses of a curvaton field with the most recent constraints on
($n_{s},r$) and two exemplary inflation models, the Starobinsky model, and a
model of new inflation. Our analysis invokes three free parameters: the
curvaton mass $m_{\chi}$, its decay rate $\Gamma_{\chi}$ the reheating
temperature $T_{\rm RH}$ produced by inflaton decays. We systematically analyze
possible post-inflationary era scenarios of a curvaton field. By projecting the
most recent CMB data on ($n_{s},r$) into this parameter space, we can either
set constraints on the curvaton parameters from successful models of inflation
(so that the success is not spoiled) or determine the parameters which are able
to save a model for which $n_{s}$ is predicted to be below the experimental
data. We emphasize that the initial value of $\langle \chi^2 \rangle \propto
H^4/m_\chi^2$ produced during inflation is determined from a stochastic
approach and thus not a free parameter in our analysis. We also investigate the
production of local non-Gaussianity $f_{NL}^{(\rm loc)}$ and apply current CMB
constraints to the parameter space. Intriguingly, we find that a large value of
$f_{NL}^{(\rm loc)}$ of $\mathcal{O}(1)$ can be produced for both of the two
representative inflation models.


### Generalized Komar charges and Smarr formulas for black holes and boson stars

**PDF Url**: [2409.08268v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08268v1)

**Abstract**: The standard Komar charge is a $(d-2)$-form that can be defined in spacetimes
admitting a Killing vector and which is closed when the vacuum Einstein
equations are satisfied. Its integral at spatial infinity (the Komar integral)
gives the conserved charge associated to the Killing vector, and, due to its
on-shell closedness, the same value (expressed in terms of other physical
variables) is obtained integrating over the event horizon (if any). This
equality is the basis of the Smarr formula. This charge can be generalized so
that it still is closed on-shell in presence of matter and its integrals give
generalizations of the Smarr formula. We show how the Komar charge and other
closed $(d-2)$-form charges can be used to prove non-existence theorems for
gravitational solitons and boson stars. In particular, we show how one can deal
with generalized symmetric fields (invariant under a combination of isometries
and other global symmetries) and how the geralized symmetric ansatz permits to
evade the non-existence theorems.

**PDF Url**: [2409.08244v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08244v1)

**Abstract**: As a mediator of the weak nuclear force, the W boson influences many
properties of fundamental particles and their interactions. Understanding the W
boson as accurately as possible, including knowing its mass, has been a
priority in particle physics for decades. In the past few years, in a
succession of increasing-precision measurements by multiple experiments, a
significant tension between the measured and predicted mass has been documented
by the CDF Collaboration. Furthermore, smaller differences between different
measurements exist. Because the W boson mass provides a window on new physics,
a comparison between different measurement techniques can inform the path to
further investigations. This Perspective article overviews the role of the W
boson mass in the Standard Model of Particle Physics and its extensions,
compares and contrasts its measurement techniques and discusses prospects and
future directions.


### Adaptive Manipulation using Behavior Trees
**Authors**: Jacques Cloete, Wolfgang Merkt, Ioannis Havoutis

**Published Date**: 2024-06-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2406.14634v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.14634v2)

**Abstract**: Many manipulation tasks pose a challenge since they depend on non-visual
environmental information that can only be determined after sustained physical
interaction has already begun. This is particularly relevant for
effort-sensitive, dynamics-dependent tasks such as tightening a valve. To
perform these tasks safely and reliably, robots must be able to quickly adapt
in response to unexpected changes during task execution. Humans can intuitively
respond and adapt their manipulation strategy to suit such problems, but
representing and implementing such behaviors for robots remains an open
question. We present the adaptive behavior tree, which enables a robot to
quickly adapt to both visual and non-visual observations during task execution,
preempting task failure or switching to a different strategy based on data from
previous attempts. We test our approach on a number of tasks commonly found in
industrial settings. Our results demonstrate safety, robustness (100% success
rate for all but one experiment) and efficiency in task completion (eg, an
overall task speedup of 46% on average for valve tightening), and would reduce
dependency on human supervision and intervention.


### Black Holes, Complex Curves, and Graph Theory: Revising a Conjecture by Kasner
**Authors**: Yen Chin Ong

**Published Date**: 2024-09-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.08236v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08236v1)

**Abstract**: The ratios $\sqrt{8/9}=2\sqrt{2}/3\approx 0.9428$ and $\sqrt{3}/2 \approx
0.866$ appear in various contexts of black hole physics, as values of the
charge-to-mass ratio $Q/M$ or the rotation parameter $a/M$ for
Reissner-Nordstr\"om and Kerr black holes, respectively. In this work, in the
Reissner-Nordstr\"om case, I relate these ratios with the quantization of the
horizon area, or equivalently of the entropy. Furthermore, these ratios are
related to a century-old work of Kasner, in which he conjectured that certain
sequences arising from complex analysis may have a quantum interpretation.
These numbers also appear in the case of Kerr black holes, but the explanation
is not as straightforward. The Kasner ratio may also be relevant for
understanding the random matrix and random graph approaches to black hole
physics, such as fast scrambling of quantum information, via a bound related to
Ramanujan graph. Intriguingly, some other pure mathematical problems in complex
analysis, notably complex interpolation in the unit disk, appear to share some
mathematical expressions with the black hole problem and thus also involve the
Kasner ratio.

**Authors**: Jinsu Kim, Jaemin Seo

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.08231v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08231v1)

**Abstract**: This research explores the application of Deep Reinforcement Learning (DRL)
to optimize the design of a nuclear fusion reactor. DRL can efficiently address
the challenging issues attributed to multiple physics and engineering
constraints for steady-state operation. The fusion reactor design computation
and the optimization code applicable to parallelization with DRL are developed.
The proposed framework enables finding the optimal reactor design that
satisfies the operational requirements while reducing building costs.
Multi-objective design optimization for a fusion reactor is now simplified by
DRL, indicating the high potential of the proposed framework for advancing the
efficient and sustainable design of future reactors.


### Investigating the Design--Science Connection in a multi-week Engineering Design (ED)-based introductory physics laboratory task

**Abstract**: Reform documents advocate for innovative pedagogical strategies to enhance
student learning. A key innovation is the integration of science and
engineering practices through Engineering Design (ED)-based physics laboratory
tasks, where students tackle engineering design problems by applying physics
principles. While this approach has its benefits, research shows that students
do not always effectively apply scientific concepts, but instead rely on
trial-and-error approaches, and end up gadgeteering their way to a solution.
This leads to what is commonly referred to as the "design-science gap" -- that
students do not always consciously apply science concepts while solving a
design problem. However, as obvious as the notion of a `gap' may appear, there
seems to exist no consensus on the definitions of `design' and `science',
further complicating the understanding of this `gap'. This qualitative study
addresses the notion of the design-science gap by examining student-groups'
discussions and written lab reports from a multi-week ED-based undergraduate
introductory physics laboratory task. Building on our earlier studies, we
developed and employed a nuanced, multi-layered coding scheme inspired by the
Gioia Framework to characterize `design thinking' and `science thinking'. We
discuss how student-groups engage in various aspects of design and how they
apply concepts physics principles to solve the problem. In the process, we
demonstrate the interconnectedness of students' design thinking and science
thinking. We advocate for the usage of the term ``design--science connection''
as opposed to ``design--science gap'' to deepen both design and scientific
thinking. Our findings offer valuable insights for educators in design-based
science education.


### Quantifying the breakdown scale of pionless effective field theory
**Authors**: Andreas Ekström, Lucas Platter

**Published Date**: 2024-09-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.08197v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08197v1)

**Abstract**: We use Bayesian statistics to infer the breakdown scale of pionless effective
field theory in its standard power counting and with renormalization of
observables carried out using the power-divergence subtraction scheme and
cutoff regularization. We condition our inference on predictions of the total
neutron-proton scattering cross section up next-to-next-to leading order. We
quantify a median breakdown scale of approximately 1.4$m_\pi$. The 68% degree
of belief interval is $[0.96,1.69]m_\pi$. This result confirms the canonical
expectation that the pion mass is a relevant scale in low-energy nuclear
physics.


### Acoustic higher-order topological insulator from momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries
**Authors**: Jinbing Hu, Kai Zhou, Tianle Song, Xuntao Jiang, Songlin Zhuang, Yi Yang

**Published Date**: 2024-09-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.08196v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08196v1)

**Abstract**: Momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries, stemming from the projective algebra
of synthetic gauge fields, can modify the manifold of the Brillouin zone and
lead to a variety of topological phenomena. We present an acoustic realization
of higher-order topological insulators (HOTIs) protected by a pair of
anticommutative momentum-space glide reflections. We confirm the presence of
momentum-space glide reflection from the measured momentum half translation of
edge bands and their momentum-resolved probability distribution using a
cylinder geometry made of acoustic resonator arrays. In particular, we observe
both intrinsic and extrinsic HOTI features in such a cylinder: hopping strength
variation along the open boundary leads to a bulk gap closure, while that along
the closed boundary results in an edge gap closure. In addition, we confirm the
presence of quadrupole corner modes with transmission and field distribution
measurements. Our observation enriches the study of topological physics of
momentum-space nonsymmorphic symmetries.


### Converting sWeights to Probabilities with Density Ratios
**Authors**: D. I. Glazier, R. Tyson

**Published Date**: 2024-09-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.08183v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08183v1)

**Abstract**: The use of machine learning approaches continues to have many benefits in
experimental nuclear and particle physics. One common issue is generating
training data which is sufficiently realistic to give reliable results. Here we
advocate using real experimental data as the source of training data and
demonstrate how one might subtract background contributions through the use of
probabilistic weights which can be readily applied to training data. The sPlot
formalism is a common tool used to isolate distributions from different
sources. However, negative sWeights produced by the sPlot technique can lead to
issues in training and poor predictive power. This article demonstrates how
density ratio estimation can be applied to convert sWeights to event
probabilities, which we call drWeights. The drWeights can then be applied to
produce the distributions of interest and are consistent with direct use of the
sWeights. This article will also show how decision trees are particular well
suited to converting sWeights, with the benefit of fast prediction rates and
adaptability to aspects of the experimental data such as data sample size and
proportions of different event sources. We also show that a double density
ratio approach where the initial drWeights are reweighted by an additional
classifier gives substantially better results.


## Diffusion
### Click2Mask: Local Editing with Dynamic Mask Generation
**Authors**: Omer Regev, Omri Avrahami, Dani Lischinski

**Published Date**: 2024-09-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.08272v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08272v1)

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in generative models have revolutionized image generation
and editing, making these tasks accessible to non-experts. This paper focuses
on local image editing, particularly the task of adding new content to a
loosely specified area. Existing methods often require a precise mask or a
detailed description of the location, which can be cumbersome and prone to
errors. We propose Click2Mask, a novel approach that simplifies the local
editing process by requiring only a single point of reference (in addition to
the content description). A mask is dynamically grown around this point during
a Blended Latent Diffusion (BLD) process, guided by a masked CLIP-based
semantic loss. Click2Mask surpasses the limitations of segmentation-based and
fine-tuning dependent methods, offering a more user-friendly and contextually
accurate solution. Our experiments demonstrate that Click2Mask not only
minimizes user effort but also delivers competitive or superior local image
manipulation results compared to SoTA methods, according to both human
judgement and automatic metrics. Key contributions include the simplification
of user input, the ability to freely add objects unconstrained by existing
segments, and the integration potential of our dynamic mask approach within
other editing methods.


### DreamBeast: Distilling 3D Fantastical Animals with Part-Aware Knowledge Transfer
**Authors**: Runjia Li, Junlin Han, Luke Melas-Kyriazi, Chunyi Sun, Zhaochong An, Zhongrui Gui, Shuyang Sun, Philip Torr, Tomas Jakab

**Published Date**: 2024-09-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.08271v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08271v1)

**Abstract**: We present DreamBeast, a novel method based on score distillation sampling
(SDS) for generating fantastical 3D animal assets composed of distinct parts.
Existing SDS methods often struggle with this generation task due to a limited
understanding of part-level semantics in text-to-image diffusion models. While
recent diffusion models, such as Stable Diffusion 3, demonstrate a better
part-level understanding, they are prohibitively slow and exhibit other common
problems associated with single-view diffusion models. DreamBeast overcomes
this limitation through a novel part-aware knowledge transfer mechanism. For
each generated asset, we efficiently extract part-level knowledge from the
Stable Diffusion 3 model into a 3D Part-Affinity implicit representation. This
enables us to instantly generate Part-Affinity maps from arbitrary camera
views, which we then use to modulate the guidance of a multi-view diffusion
model during SDS to create 3D assets of fantastical animals. DreamBeast
significantly enhances the quality of generated 3D creatures with
user-specified part compositions while reducing computational overhead, as
demonstrated by extensive quantitative and qualitative evaluations.


### LoRID: Low-Rank Iterative Diffusion for Adversarial Purification
**Authors**: Geigh Zollicoffer, Minh Vu, Ben Nebgen, Juan Castorena, Boian Alexandrov, Manish Bhattarai

**Published Date**: 2024-09-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.08255v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08255v1)

**Abstract**: This work presents an information-theoretic examination of diffusion-based
purification methods, the state-of-the-art adversarial defenses that utilize
diffusion models to remove malicious perturbations in adversarial examples. By
theoretically characterizing the inherent purification errors associated with
the Markov-based diffusion purifications, we introduce LoRID, a novel Low-Rank
Iterative Diffusion purification method designed to remove adversarial
perturbation with low intrinsic purification errors. LoRID centers around a
multi-stage purification process that leverages multiple rounds of
diffusion-denoising loops at the early time-steps of the diffusion models, and
the integration of Tucker decomposition, an extension of matrix factorization,
to remove adversarial noise at high-noise regimes. Consequently, LoRID
increases the effective diffusion time-steps and overcomes strong adversarial
attacks, achieving superior robustness performance in CIFAR-10/100, CelebA-HQ,
and ImageNet datasets under both white-box and black-box settings.


### IFAdapter: Instance Feature Control for Grounded Text-to-Image Generation
**Authors**: Yinwei Wu, Xianpan Zhou, Bing Ma, Xuefeng Su, Kai Ma, Xinchao Wang

**Published Date**: 2024-09-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.08240v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08240v1)

**Abstract**: While Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models excel at generating visually
appealing images of individual instances, they struggle to accurately position
and control the features generation of multiple instances. The Layout-to-Image
(L2I) task was introduced to address the positioning challenges by
incorporating bounding boxes as spatial control signals, but it still falls
short in generating precise instance features. In response, we propose the
Instance Feature Generation (IFG) task, which aims to ensure both positional
accuracy and feature fidelity in generated instances. To address the IFG task,
we introduce the Instance Feature Adapter (IFAdapter). The IFAdapter enhances
feature depiction by incorporating additional appearance tokens and utilizing
an Instance Semantic Map to align instance-level features with spatial
locations. The IFAdapter guides the diffusion process as a plug-and-play
module, making it adaptable to various community models. For evaluation, we
contribute an IFG benchmark and develop a verification pipeline to objectively
compare models' abilities to generate instances with accurate positioning and
features. Experimental results demonstrate that IFAdapter outperforms other
models in both quantitative and qualitative evaluations.


### LT3SD: Latent Trees for 3D Scene Diffusion
**Authors**: Quan Meng, Lei Li, Matthias Nießner, Angela Dai

**Published Date**: 2024-09-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-12

**PDF Url**: [2409.08215v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.08215v1)

**Abstract**: We present LT3SD, a novel latent diffusion model for large-scale 3D scene
generation. Recent advances in diffusion models have shown impressive results
in 3D object generation, but are limited in spatial extent and quality when
extended to 3D scenes. To generate complex and diverse 3D scene structures, we
introduce a latent tree representation to effectively encode both
lower-frequency geometry and higher-frequency detail in a coarse-to-fine
hierarchy. We can then learn a generative diffusion process in this latent 3D
scene space, modeling the latent components of a scene at each resolution
level. To synthesize large-scale scenes with varying sizes, we train our
diffusion model on scene patches and synthesize arbitrary-sized output 3D
scenes through shared diffusion generation across multiple scene patches.
Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate the efficacy and benefits of
LT3SD for large-scale, high-quality unconditional 3D scene generation and for
probabilistic completion for partial scene observations.
