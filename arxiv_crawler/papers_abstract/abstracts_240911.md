**Abstract**: Density matrices are the most general descriptions of quantum states,
covering both pure and mixed states. Positive semidefiniteness is a physical
requirement of density matrices, imposing nonnegative probabilities of
measuring physical values. Separately, nonlocality is a property shared by some
bipartite quantum systems, indicating a correlation of the component parts that
cannot be described by local classical variables. In this work, we show that
breaking the positive-semidefinite requirement and allowing states with a
negative minimal eigenvalue arbitrarily close to zero, allows for the
construction of states that are nonlocal under one component labelling but
local when the labelling is interchanged. This is an observer-dependent
nonlocality, showing the connection between nonlocal objectivism and negative
quasi-probabilities.

**Abstract**: Social physics explores responses to information exchange in a social
network, and can be mapped down to bacterial collective signaling. Here, we
explore how social inter-bacterial communication includes coordination of
response to communication loss, as opposed to solitary searching for food, with
collective response emergence at the population level. We present a
2-dimensional enclosed microfluidic environment that utilizes concentric rings
of funnel ratchets, which direct motile E.coli bacteria towards a sole exit
hole, an information ``black hole'', passage into the black hole irreversibly
sweeps the bacteria away via hydrodynamic flow. We show that the spatiotemporal
evolution of entropy production reveals how bacteria avoid crossing the
hydrodynamic black hole information horizon.

**Abstract**: The dispersive linear optical properties of materials are frequently
described using oscillator models, where the oscillators represent interactions
between light and various material resonances (vibrational, free-carrier,
interband, etc.). The state-of-the-art measurement of the complex refractive
index is variable-angle spectroscopic ellipsometry (VASE), where additional
measurement angles and the measured depolarization of light provides much more
information compared to simpler measurements such as single-angle reflectance
and transmittance. Nevertheless, even state-of-the-art VASE data can be hard to
uniquely fit using oscillator models, and the resulting models may be hard to
interpret physically. Here, we demonstrate the use of an additional degree of
freedom, temperature, to improve the accuracy, uniqueness, and physicality of
oscillator models of materials. Our approach relies on the well-understood
temperature dependence of material resonances, and in particular vibrational
resonances in amorphous SiO2, which are expected to change monotonically from
room temperature to hundreds of degrees C. We performed VASE measurements at
different temperatures, independently fitted the data at each temperature, and
then confirmed that our models are unique and physical by monitoring the
temperature dependence of the resulting fitting parameters. Using this
technique, we generated highly accurate and precise data sets and material
models describing the mid-infrared complex refractive index of three different
grades of fused SiO2, which can then be used for modeling of mid-infrared
optical components such as thermal emitters.

**Abstract**: We used physical agents with deep memories of past events and left/right
ideologies but different fixed personalities to study what drives the
polarization of the dynamic population ideology. We find that agents have a
critical memory depth below which complete ideology polarization of the
collective cannot occur and above which it is inevitable. However, depending on
the details of the personalities, the ideologies polarization can be static or
dynamic in time, even chaotic. Thus, agents with different personalities and
levels of memory (mnemomatter) can serve as a physics analogue of the ideology
dynamics among ideological beings, illuminating how decisions influenced by
individual memories of past interactions can shape and influence subsequent
ideology polarization. Each constituent agent harbors a private stack memory
and an onboard microcomputer/controller which both measures and controls its
physical spin handedness, which is a proxy for ideology. The agent's decision
to change or retain its current spin is determined by each agent's private
algorithm for decisions (the personality) and the time-weighted stack history
of present and previous interactions. Depending on a given agent's personality
for evaluating its memory and experiences, an agent can act as a curmudgeon who
never changes its ideology, a pushover who always accepts change, a contrarian
who always does the opposite of what is expected, an opportunist who weighs
recent events more heavily than past events in making decisions, and a
traditionalist who weighs past events more heavily than recent events in
decision making. We develop a field theory which maps agent ideological
polarization over into a dynamic potential landscape. Perhaps such applications
of physics-based systems to political systems will help us to understand the
ideological instability observed in the world today.


### Les Houches lecture notes on topological recursion

**PDF Url**: [2409.06657v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06657v1)

**Abstract**: You may have seen the words "topological recursion" mentioned in papers on
matrix models, Hurwitz theory, Gromov-Witten theory, topological string theory,
knot theory, topological field theory, JT gravity, cohomological field theory,
free probability theory, gauge theories, to name a few. The goal of these
lecture notes is certainly not to explain all these applications of the
topological recursion framework. Rather, the intention is to provide a
down-to-earth (and hopefully accessible) introduction to topological recursion
itself, so that when you see these words mentioned, you can understand what it
is all about. These lecture notes accompanied a series of lectures at the Les
Houches school "Quantum Geometry (Mathematical Methods for Gravity, Gauge
Theories and Non-Perturbative Physics)" in Summer 2024.


### Interference effects in resonant di-Higgs production at the LHC in the Higgs singlet extension
**Authors**: Finn Feuerstake, Elina Fuchs, Tania Robens, Daniel Winterbottom

**Published Date**: 2024-09-10

**PDF Url**: [2409.06651v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06651v1)

**Abstract**: Interference effects are well founded from the quantum mechanical viewpoint
and in principle cannot be ignored in realistic studies of New Physics
scenarios. In this work, we investigate the size of interference effects
between resonant and non-resonant contributions to di-Higgs production in the
singlet extension of the Standard Model where the additional heavy scalar
provides a resonant channel of on-shell and off-shell di-Higgs production. We
find these interference contributions to have a non-negligible effect on the
cross-sections and differential distributions. In order to allow for an
computationally efficient treatment of these effects via reweighting, we
introduce a new tool utilizing a matrix-element reweighting method:
HHReweighter. In addition to the broadly used invariant di-Higgs mass $m_{hh}$,
we analyze the sensitivity of other kinematic variables to the interference
term and propose to also use differential distributions in the Higgs transverse
momentum $p_T^h$. Furthermore, we provide updates on the latest experimental
and theoretical limits on the parameter space of the real singlet extension of
the Standard Model Higgs sector.


### KANtrol: A Physics-Informed Kolmogorov-Arnold Network Framework for Solving Multi-Dimensional and Fractional Optimal Control Problems
**Authors**: Alireza Afzal Aghaei

**Published Date**: 2024-09-10

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-10

**PDF Url**: [2409.06649v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06649v1)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we introduce the KANtrol framework, which utilizes
Kolmogorov-Arnold Networks (KANs) to solve optimal control problems involving
continuous time variables. We explain how Gaussian quadrature can be employed
to approximate the integral parts within the problem, particularly for
integro-differential state equations. We also demonstrate how automatic
differentiation is utilized to compute exact derivatives for integer-order
dynamics, while for fractional derivatives of non-integer order, we employ
matrix-vector product discretization within the KAN framework. We tackle
multi-dimensional problems, including the optimal control of a 2D heat partial
differential equation. The results of our simulations, which cover both forward
and parameter identification problems, show that the KANtrol framework
outperforms classical MLPs in terms of accuracy and efficiency.


### Duality via Sequential Quantum Circuit in the Topological Holography Formalism

**PDF Url**: [2409.06647v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06647v1)

**Abstract**: Two quantum theories which look different but are secretly describing the
same low-energy physics are said to be dual to each other. When realized in the
Topological Holography formalism, duality corresponds to changing the gapped
boundary condition on the top boundary of a topological field theory, which
determines the symmetry of the system, while not affecting the bottom boundary
where all the dynamics take place. In this paper, we show that duality in the
Topological Holography formalism can be realized with a Sequential Quantum
Circuit applied to the top boundary. As a consequence, the Hamiltonians before
and after the duality mapping have exactly the same spectrum in the
corresponding symmetry sectors, and the entanglement in the corresponding
low-energy eigenstates differs by at most an area law term.

**PDF Url**: [2409.06615v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06615v1)

**Abstract**: Human demonstrations as prompts are a powerful way to program robots to do
long-horizon manipulation tasks. However, directly translating such
demonstrations into robot-executable actions poses significant challenges due
to execution mismatches, such as different movement styles and physical
capabilities. Existing methods either rely on robot-demonstrator paired data,
which is infeasible to scale, or overly rely on frame-level visual
similarities, which fail to hold. To address these challenges, we propose
RHyME, a novel framework that automatically establishes task execution
correspondences between the robot and the demonstrator by using optimal
transport costs. Given long-horizon robot demonstrations, RHyME synthesizes
semantically equivalent human demonstrations by retrieving and composing
similar short-horizon human clips, facilitating effective policy training
without the need for paired data. We show that RHyME outperforms a range of
baselines across various cross-embodiment datasets on all degrees of
mismatches. Through detailed analysis, we uncover insights for learning and
leveraging cross-embodiment visual representations.

**PDF Url**: [2409.06599v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06599v1)

**Abstract**: Gravitational waves from cosmological phase transitions are novel probes of
fundamental physics, making their precise calculation essential for revealing
various mysteries of the early Universe. In this work we propose a framework
that enables the consistent calculation of such gravitational waves sourced by
sound waves. Starting from the Lagrangian, this framework integrates the
calculation of the dynamics of first-order phase transitions in a
self-consistent manner, eliminating various approximations typically introduced
by conventional methods. At the heart of our approach is the congruous
evaluation of the phase transition hydrodynamics that, at every step, is
consistently informed by the Lagrangian. We demonstrate the application of our
framework using the SM+$|H|^6$ model, deriving the corresponding gravitational
wave spectrum. Our framework establishes a robust foundation for the precise
prediction of gravitational waves from phase transitions.

**Abstract**: Understanding the behavior of complex molecular systems is a fundamental
problem in physical chemistry. To describe the long-time dynamics of such
systems, which is responsible for their most informative characteristics, we
can identify a few slow collective variables (CVs) while treating the remaining
fast variables as thermal noise. This enables us to simplify the dynamics and
treat it as diffusion in a free-energy landscape spanned by slow CVs,
effectively rendering the dynamics Markovian. Our recent statistical learning
technique, spectral map [Rydzewski, J. Phys. Chem. Lett. 2023, 14, 22,
5216-5220], explores this strategy to learn slow CVs by maximizing a spectral
gap of a transition matrix. In this work, we introduce several advancements
into our framework, using a high-dimensional reversible folding process of a
protein as an example. We implement an algorithm for coarse-graining Markov
transition matrices to partition the reduced space of slow CVs kinetically and
use it to define a transition state ensemble. We show that slow CVs learned by
spectral map closely approach the Markovian limit for an overdamped diffusion.
We demonstrate that coordinate-dependent diffusion coefficients only slightly
affect the constructed free-energy landscapes. Finally, we present how spectral
map can be used to quantify the importance of features and compare slow CVs
with structural descriptors commonly used in protein folding. Overall, we
demonstrate that a single slow CV learned by spectral map can be used as a
physical reaction coordinate to capture essential characteristics of protein
folding.


### Distilling Generative-Discriminative Representations for Very Low-Resolution Face Recognition
**Authors**: Junzheng Zhang, Weijia Guo, Bochao Liu, Ruixin Shi, Yong Li, Shiming Ge

**Abstract**: Very low-resolution face recognition is challenging due to the serious loss
of informative facial details in resolution degradation. In this paper, we
propose a generative-discriminative representation distillation approach that
combines generative representation with cross-resolution aligned knowledge
distillation. This approach facilitates very low-resolution face recognition by
jointly distilling generative and discriminative models via two distillation
modules. Firstly, the generative representation distillation takes the encoder
of a diffusion model pretrained for face super-resolution as the generative
teacher to supervise the learning of the student backbone via feature
regression, and then freezes the student backbone. After that, the
discriminative representation distillation further considers a pretrained face
recognizer as the discriminative teacher to supervise the learning of the
student head via cross-resolution relational contrastive distillation. In this
way, the general backbone representation can be transformed into discriminative
head representation, leading to a robust and discriminative student model for
very low-resolution face recognition. Our approach improves the recovery of the
missing details in very low-resolution faces and achieves better knowledge
transfer. Extensive experiments on face datasets demonstrate that our approach
enhances the recognition accuracy of very low-resolution faces, showcasing its
effectiveness and adaptability.


### What happens to diffusion model likelihood when your model is conditional?
**Authors**: Mattias Cross, Anton Ragni

**Published Date**: 2024-09-10

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-10

**PDF Url**: [2409.06364v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06364v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion Models (DMs) iteratively denoise random samples to produce
high-quality data. The iterative sampling process is derived from Stochastic
Differential Equations (SDEs), allowing a speed-quality trade-off chosen at
inference. Another advantage of sampling with differential equations is exact
likelihood computation. These likelihoods have been used to rank unconditional
DMs and for out-of-domain classification. Despite the many existing and
possible uses of DM likelihoods, the distinct properties captured are unknown,
especially in conditional contexts such as Text-To-Image (TTI) or
Text-To-Speech synthesis (TTS). Surprisingly, we find that TTS DM likelihoods
are agnostic to the text input. TTI likelihood is more expressive but cannot
discern confounding prompts. Our results show that applying DMs to conditional
tasks reveals inconsistencies and strengthens claims that the properties of DM
likelihood are unknown. This impact sheds light on the previously unknown
nature of DM likelihoods. Although conditional DMs maximise likelihood, the
likelihood in question is not as sensitive to the conditioning input as one
expects. This investigation provides a new point-of-view on diffusion
likelihoods.


### Targeting the partition function of chemically disordered materials with a generative approach based on inverse variational autoencoders

**Abstract**: Computing atomic-scale properties of chemically disordered materials requires
an efficient exploration of their vast configuration space. Traditional
approaches such as Monte Carlo or Special Quasirandom Structures either entail
sampling an excessive amount of configurations or do not ensure that the
configuration space has been properly covered. In this work, we propose a novel
approach where generative machine learning is used to yield a representative
set of configurations for accurate property evaluation and provide accurate
estimations of atomic-scale properties with minimal computational cost. Our
method employs a specific type of variational autoencoder with inverse roles
for the encoder and decoder, enabling the application of an unsupervised active
learning scheme that does not require any initial training database. The model
iteratively generates configuration batches, whose properties are computed with
conventional atomic-scale methods. These results are then fed back into the
model to estimate the partition function, repeating the process until
convergence. We illustrate our approach by computing point-defect formation
energies and concentrations in (U, Pu)O2 mixed-oxide fuels. In addition, the ML
model provides valuable insights into the physical factors influencing the
target property. Our method is generally applicable to explore other
properties, such as atomic-scale diffusion coefficients, in ideally or
non-ideally disordered materials like high-entropy alloys.


### Market Reaction to News Flows in Supply Chain Networks
**Authors**: Hiroyasu Inoue, Yasuyuki Todo

**Published Date**: 2024-09-10

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-10

**PDF Url**: [2409.06255v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.06255v1)

**Abstract**: This study examines whether positive news about firms increases their stock
prices and, moreover, whether it increases stock prices of the firms' suppliers
and customers, using a large sample of publicly listed firms across the world
and another of Japanese listed firms. The level of positiveness of each news
article is determined by FinBERT, a natural language processing model
fine-tuned specifically for financial information. Supply chains of firms
across the world are identified mostly by financial statements, while those of
Japanese firms are taken from large-scale firm-level surveys. We find that
positive news increases the change rate of stock prices of firms mentioned in
the news before its disclosure, most likely because of diffusion of information
through informal channels. Positive news also raises stock prices of the firms'
suppliers and customers before its disclosure, confirming propagation of market
values through supply chains. In addition, we generally find a larger post-news
effect on stock prices of the mentioned firms and their suppliers and customers
than the pre-news effect. The positive difference between the post- and
pre-news effects can be considered as the net effect of the disclosure of
positive news, controlling for informal information diffusion. However, the
post-news effect on suppliers and customers in Japan is smaller than the
pre-news effect, a result opposite to those from firms across the world. This
notable result is possibly because supply chain links of Japanese firms are
stronger than global supply chains while such knowledge is restricted to
selected investors.
