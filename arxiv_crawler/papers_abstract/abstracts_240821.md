**Abstract**: The advent of quantum computers has justified the development of quantum
machine learning algorithms , based on the adaptation of the principles of
machine learning to the formalism of qubits. Among such quantum algorithms,
anomaly detection represents an important problem crossing several disciplines
from cybersecurity, to fraud detection to particle physics. We summarize the
key concepts involved in quantum computing, introducing the formal concept of
quantum speed up. The survey provides a structured map of anomaly detection
based on quantum machine learning. We have grouped existing algorithms
according to the different learning methods, namely quantum supervised, quantum
unsupervised and quantum reinforcement learning, respectively. We provide an
estimate of the hardware resources to provide sufficient computational power in
the future. The survey provides a systematic and compact understanding of the
techniques belonging to each category. We eventually provide a discussion on
the computational complexity of the learning methods in real application
domains.

**Abstract**: Solitons in two-dimensional quantum field theory exhibit patterns of
degeneracies and associated selection rules on scattering amplitudes. We
develop a representation theory that captures these intriguing features of
solitons. This representation theory is based on an algebra we refer to as the
"strip algebra", $\textrm{Str}_{\mathcal{C}}(\mathcal{M})$, which is defined in
terms of the non-invertible symmetry, $\mathcal{C},$ a fusion category, and its
action on boundary conditions encoded by a module category, $\mathcal{M}$. The
strip algebra is a $C^*$-weak Hopf algebra, a fact which can be elegantly
deduced by quantizing the three-dimensional Drinfeld center TQFT,
$\mathcal{Z}(\mathcal{C}),$ on a spatial manifold with corners. These
structures imply that the representation category of the strip algebra is also
a unitary fusion category which we identify with a dual category
$\mathcal{C}_{\mathcal{M}}^{*}.$ We present a straightforward method for
analyzing these representations in terms of quiver diagrams where nodes are
vacua and arrows are solitons and provide examples demonstrating how the
representation theory reproduces known degeneracies and selection rules of
soliton scattering. Our analysis provides the general framework for analyzing
non-invertible symmetry on manifolds with boundary and applies both to the case
of boundaries at infinity, relevant to particle physics, and boundaries at
finite distance, relevant in conformal field theory or condensed matter
systems.

**PDF Url**: [2408.11035v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11035v1)

**Abstract**: This Letter presents a search for highly ionizing magnetic monopoles in
262$~\mu$b$^{-1}$ of ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collision data at
$\sqrt{s_{_\textrm{NN}}}=5.36$ TeV collected by the ATLAS detector at the LHC.
A new methodology that exploits the properties of clusters of hits
reconstructed in the innermost silicon detector layers is introduced to study
highly ionizing particles in heavy-ion data. No significant excess above the
background, which is estimated using a data-driven technique, is observed.
Using a nonperturbative semiclassical model, upper limits at 95% confidence
level are set on the cross-section for pair production of monopoles with a
single Dirac magnetic charge in the mass range of 20-150 GeV. The search
significantly improves on the previous cross-section limits for production of
low-mass monopoles in ultraperipheral Pb+Pb collisions.

**Abstract**: Accurately describing the distribution of CO$_2$ in the atmosphere with
atmospheric tracer transport models is essential for greenhouse gas monitoring
and verification support systems to aid implementation of international climate
agreements. Large deep neural networks are poised to revolutionize weather
prediction, which requires 3D modeling of the atmosphere. While similar in this
regard, atmospheric transport modeling is subject to new challenges. Both,
stable predictions for longer time horizons and mass conservation throughout
need to be achieved, while IO plays a larger role compared to computational
costs. In this study we explore four different deep neural networks (UNet,
GraphCast, Spherical Fourier Neural Operator and SwinTransformer) which have
proven as state-of-the-art in weather prediction to assess their usefulness for
atmospheric tracer transport modeling. For this, we assemble the CarbonBench
dataset, a systematic benchmark tailored for machine learning emulators of
Eulerian atmospheric transport. Through architectural adjustments, we decouple
the performance of our emulators from the distribution shift caused by a steady
rise in atmospheric CO$_2$. More specifically, we center CO$_2$ input fields to
zero mean and then use an explicit flux scheme and a mass fixer to assure mass
balance. This design enables stable and mass conserving transport for over 6
months with all four neural network architectures. In our study, the
SwinTransformer displays particularly strong emulation skill (90-day $R^2 >
0.99$), with physically plausible emulation even for forward runs of multiple
years. This work paves the way forward towards high resolution forward and
inverse modeling of inert trace gases with neural networks.


### Hubble Tension or Distance Ladder Crisis?
**Authors**: Leandros Perivolaropoulos

**Published Date**: 2024-08-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-20

**PDF Url**: [2408.11031v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11031v1)

**Abstract**: We present an up-to-date compilation of published Hubble constant ($H_0$)
measurements that are independent of the CMB sound horizon scale. This
compilation is categorized into two distinct groups: A. Distance Ladder
Measurements: This group comprises 19 recent measurements, primarily from the
past four years, utilizing various rung 2 calibrators and rung 3 cosmic
distance indicators. B.One-Step Measurements: This category includes 31
measurements of $H_0$ that are independent of both the CMB sound horizon scale
and the distance ladder approach. These are derived from diverse probes such as
Cosmic Chronometers, gamma-ray attenuation, time-delay strong lensing,
megamasers etc. Statistical analysis reveals a significant distinction between
these two groups. The distance ladder-based measurements yield a weighted mean
$H_0 = 72.76 \pm 0.50$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$, while the one-step measurements
result in a weighted mean $H_0 = 69.01 \pm 0.49$ km s$^{-1}$ Mpc$^{-1}$. To
quantify the statistical significance of this difference, we implemented a
Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test, which yielded a p-value of 0.000102. This
extremely low p-value strongly indicates that the two samples are fundamentally
distinct, with a probability of less than 0.01\% that they are drawn from the
same underlying distribution. These findings suggest that late-time one-step
measurements of $H_0$ are more consistent with early-time measurements,
indicating that the core of the Hubble tension lies not between early-time and
late-time measurements per se, but specifically between distance ladder
measurements and all other $H_0$ determinations. This discrepancy points to
either a systematic effect influencing all distance ladder measurements or a
fundamental physics anomaly affecting at least one rung of the distance ladder.


### Enhanced Shadow Tomography of Molecular Excited States from Enforcing $N$-representability Conditions by Semidefinite Programming
**Authors**: Irma Avdic, David A. Mazziotti

**Published Date**: 2024-08-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-20

**PDF Url**: [2408.11025v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11025v1)

**Abstract**: Excited-state properties of highly correlated systems are key to
understanding photosynthesis, luminescence, and the development of novel
optical materials, but accurately capturing their interactions is
computationally costly. We present an algorithm that combines classical shadow
tomography with physical constraints on the two-electron reduced density matrix
(2-RDM) to treat excited states. The method reduces the number of measurements
of the many-electron 2-RDM on quantum computers by (i) approximating the
quantum state through a random sampling technique called shadow tomography and
(ii) ensuring that the 2-RDM represents an $N$-electron system through imposing
$N$-representability constraints by semidefinite programming. This generalizes
recent work on the $N$-representability-enhanced shadow tomography of
ground-state 2-RDMs. We compute excited-state energies and 2-RDMs of the H$_4$
chain and analyze the critical points along the photoexcited reaction pathway
from gauche-1,3-butadiene to bicyclobutane via a conical intersection. The
results show that the generalized shadow tomography retains critical
multireference correlation effects while significantly reducing the number of
required measurements, offering a promising avenue for the efficient treatment
of electronically excited states on quantum devices.


### Learning Realistic Joint Space Boundaries for Range of Motion Analysis of Healthy and Impaired Human Arms
**Authors**: Shafagh Keyvanian, Michelle J. Johnson, Nadia Figueroa

**Published Date**: 2023-11-17

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-20

**PDF Url**: [2311.10653v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.10653v2)

**Abstract**: A realistic human kinematic model that satisfies anatomical constraints is
essential for human-robot interaction, biomechanics and robot-assisted
rehabilitation. Modeling realistic joint constraints, however, is challenging
as human arm motion is constrained by joint limits, inter- and intra-joint
dependencies, self-collisions, individual capabilities and muscular or
neurological constraints which are difficult to represent. Hence, physicians
and researchers have relied on simple box-constraints, ignoring important
anatomical factors. In this paper, we propose a data-driven method to learn
realistic anatomically constrained upper-limb range of motion (RoM) boundaries
from motion capture data. This is achieved by fitting a one-class support
vector machine to a dataset of upper-limb joint space exploration motions with
an efficient hyper-parameter tuning scheme. Our approach outperforms similar
works focused on valid RoM learning. Further, we propose an impairment index
(II) metric that offers a quantitative assessment of capability/impairment when
comparing healthy and impaired arms. We validate the metric on healthy subjects
physically constrained to emulate hemiplegia and different disability levels as
stroke patients.


### Temporal solitons in active optical resonators
**Authors**: Dmitry Kazakov, Federico Capasso, Marco Piccardo

**Published Date**: 2024-08-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-20

**PDF Url**: [2408.11020v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11020v1)

**Abstract**: Solitons, as coherent structures that maintain their shape while traveling at
constant velocity, are ubiquitous across various branches of physics, from
fluid dynamics to quantum fields. However, it is within the realm of optics
where solitons have not only served as a primary testbed for understanding
solitary wave phenomena but have also transitioned into applications ranging
from telecommunications to metrology. In the optical domain, temporal solitons
are localized light pulses, self-reinforcing via a delicate balance between
nonlinearity and dispersion. Among the many systems hosting temporal solitons,
active optical resonators stand out due to their inherent gain medium, enabling
to actively sustain solitons. Unlike conventional modelocked lasers, active
resonators offer a richer landscape for soliton dynamics through hybrid driving
schemes, such as coupling to passive cavities or under external optical
injection, affording them unparalleled control and versatility. We discuss key
advantages of these systems, with a particular focus on quantum cascade lasers
as a promising soliton technology within the class of active resonators. By
exploring diverse architectures from traditional Fabry-Perot cavities to
racetrack devices operated under external injection, we present the current
state-of-the-art and future directions for soliton-based sources in the realm
of semiconductor lasers and hybrid integrated photonic systems.


### A hierarchy of KPZ equation scaling limits arising from directed random walk models in random media
**Authors**: Shalin Parekh

**Published Date**: 2024-01-11

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-20

**PDF Url**: [2401.06073v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06073v2)

**Abstract**: We consider a generalized model of random walk in dynamical random
environment, and we show that the multiplicative-noise stochastic heat equation
(SHE) describes the fluctuations of the quenched density at a certain precise
location in the tail. The distribution of transition kernels is fixed rather
than changing under the diffusive rescaling of space-time, i.e., there is no
critical tuning of the model parameters when scaling to the stochastic PDE
limit. The proof is done by pushing the methods developed in [arxiv 2304.14279,
arXiv 2311.09151] to their maximum, substantially weakening the assumptions and
obtaining fairly sharp conditions under which one expects to see the SHE arise
in a wide variety of random walk models in random media. In particular we are
able to get rid of conditions such as nearest-neighbor interaction as well as
spatial independence of quenched transition kernels. Moreover, we observe an
entire hierarchy of moderate deviation exponents at which the SHE can be found,
confirming a physics prediction of J. Hass.


### Confined phases at finite density in the Hardwall model
**Authors**: Akash Singh, K. P. Yogendran

**Published Date**: 2024-08-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-20

**PDF Url**: [2408.10986v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10986v1)

**Abstract**: AdS/QCD models are being extensively studied because they seem to offer an
entirely tractable and radically different approach to the phases of QCD whose
region of validity is precisely the region of strong interactions. In this
context, a missing ingredient has been the absence of a bulk description dual
to a confined hadronic phase at finite baryon density. In this work, we discuss
a class of backgrounds that fill this lacuna. Applying physically motivated
boundary conditions, we obtain phase diagrams which compare reasonably with
approaches based on the PNJL model. We also show that such backgrounds can play
a similar role in geometries with a dilaton field.


## Diffusion
### Transfusion: Predict the Next Token and Diffuse Images with One Multi-Modal Model
**Authors**: Chunting Zhou, Lili Yu, Arun Babu, Kushal Tirumala, Michihiro Yasunaga, Leonid Shamis, Jacob Kahn, Xuezhe Ma, Luke Zettlemoyer, Omer Levy

**Published Date**: 2024-08-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-20

**PDF Url**: [2408.11039v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.11039v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce Transfusion, a recipe for training a multi-modal model over
discrete and continuous data. Transfusion combines the language modeling loss
function (next token prediction) with diffusion to train a single transformer
over mixed-modality sequences. We pretrain multiple Transfusion models up to 7B
parameters from scratch on a mixture of text and image data, establishing
scaling laws with respect to a variety of uni- and cross-modal benchmarks. Our
experiments show that Transfusion scales significantly better than quantizing
images and training a language model over discrete image tokens. By introducing
modality-specific encoding and decoding layers, we can further improve the
performance of Transfusion models, and even compress each image to just 16
patches. We further demonstrate that scaling our Transfusion recipe to 7B
parameters and 2T multi-modal tokens produces a model that can generate images
and text on a par with similar scale diffusion models and language models,
reaping the benefits of both worlds.

**Authors**: Hojat Asgariandehkordi, Sobhan Goudarzi, Mostafa Sharifzadeh, Adrian Basarab, Hassan Rivaz

**PDF Url**: [2408.10987v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.10987v1)

**Abstract**: Ultrasound plane wave imaging is a cutting-edge technique that enables high
frame-rate imaging. However, one challenge associated with high frame-rate
ultrasound imaging is the high noise associated with them, hindering their
wider adoption. Therefore, the development of a denoising method becomes
imperative to augment the quality of plane wave images. Drawing inspiration
from Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models (DDPMs), our proposed solution
aims to enhance plane wave image quality. Specifically, the method considers
the distinction between low-angle and high-angle compounding plane waves as
noise and effectively eliminates it by adapting a DDPM to beamformed
radiofrequency (RF) data. The method underwent training using only 400
simulated images. In addition, our approach employs natural image segmentation
masks as intensity maps for the generated images, resulting in accurate
denoising for various anatomy shapes. The proposed method was assessed across
simulation, phantom, and in vivo images. The results of the evaluations
indicate that our approach not only enhances image quality on simulated data
but also demonstrates effectiveness on phantom and in vivo data in terms of
image quality. Comparative analysis with other methods underscores the
superiority of our proposed method across various evaluation metrics. The
source code and trained model will be released along with the dataset at:

**Abstract**: Storm-scale convection-allowing models (CAMs) are an important tool for
predicting the evolution of thunderstorms and mesoscale convective systems that
result in damaging extreme weather. By explicitly resolving convective dynamics
within the atmosphere they afford meteorologists the nuance needed to provide
outlook on hazard. Deep learning models have thus far not proven skilful at
km-scale atmospheric simulation, despite being competitive at coarser
resolution with state-of-the-art global, medium-range weather forecasting. We
present a generative diffusion model called StormCast, which emulates the
high-resolution rapid refresh (HRRR) model-NOAA's state-of-the-art 3km
operational CAM. StormCast autoregressively predicts 99 state variables at km
scale using a 1-hour time step, with dense vertical resolution in the
atmospheric boundary layer, conditioned on 26 synoptic variables. We present
evidence of successfully learnt km-scale dynamics including competitive 1-6
hour forecast skill for composite radar reflectivity alongside physically
realistic convective cluster evolution, moist updrafts, and cold pool
morphology. StormCast predictions maintain realistic power spectra for multiple
predicted variables across multi-hour forecasts. Together, these results
establish the potential for autoregressive ML to emulate CAMs -- opening up new
km-scale frontiers for regional ML weather prediction and future climate hazard
dynamical downscaling.

**Authors**: Zhongliang Guo, Lei Fang, Jingyu Lin, Yifei Qian, Shuai Zhao, Zeyu Wang, Junhao Dong, Cunjian Chen, Ognjen Arandjelović, Chun Pong Lau

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in generative AI, particularly Latent Diffusion Models
(LDMs), have revolutionized image synthesis and manipulation. However, these
generative techniques raises concerns about data misappropriation and
intellectual property infringement. Adversarial attacks on machine learning
models have been extensively studied, and a well-established body of research
has extended these techniques as a benign metric to prevent the underlying
misuse of generative AI. Current approaches to safeguarding images from
manipulation by LDMs are limited by their reliance on model-specific knowledge
and their inability to significantly degrade semantic quality of generated
images. In response to these shortcomings, we propose the Posterior Collapse
Attack (PCA) based on the observation that VAEs suffer from posterior collapse
during training. Our method minimizes dependence on the white-box information
of target models to get rid of the implicit reliance on model-specific
knowledge. By accessing merely a small amount of LDM parameters, in specific
merely the VAE encoder of LDMs, our method causes a substantial semantic
collapse in generation quality, particularly in perceptual consistency, and
demonstrates strong transferability across various model architectures.
Experimental results show that PCA achieves superior perturbation effects on
image generation of LDMs with lower runtime and VRAM. Our method outperforms
existing techniques, offering a more robust and generalizable solution that is
helpful in alleviating the socio-technical challenges posed by the rapidly
evolving landscape of generative AI.


### BrainVis: Exploring the Bridge between Brain and Visual Signals via Image Reconstruction
**Authors**: Honghao Fu, Zhiqi Shen, Jing Jih Chin, Hao Wang

**Published Date**: 2023-12-22

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-20

**PDF Url**: [2312.14871v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.14871v2)

**Abstract**: Analyzing and reconstructing visual stimuli from brain signals effectively
advances the understanding of human visual system. However, the EEG signals are
complex and contain significant noise. This leads to substantial limitations in
existing works of visual stimuli reconstruction from EEG, such as difficulties
in aligning EEG embeddings with the fine-grained semantic information and a
heavy reliance on additional large self-collected dataset for training. To
address these challenges, we propose a novel approach called BrainVis. Firstly,
we divide the EEG signals into various units and apply a self-supervised
approach on them to obtain EEG time-domain features, in an attempt to ease the
training difficulty. Additionally, we also propose to utilize the
frequency-domain features to enhance the EEG representations. Then, we
simultaneously align EEG time-frequency embeddings with the interpolation of
the coarse and fine-grained semantics in the CLIP space, to highlight the
primary visual components and reduce the cross-modal alignment difficulty.
Finally, we adopt the cascaded diffusion models to reconstruct images. Using
only 10\% training data of the previous work, our proposed BrainVis outperforms
state of the arts in both semantic fidelity reconstruction and generation
quality. The code is available at https://github.com/RomGai/BrainVis.

**Abstract**: Reinforcement Learning (RL) has experienced significant advancement over the
past decade, prompting a growing interest in applications within finance. This
survey critically evaluates 167 publications, exploring diverse RL applications
and frameworks in finance. Financial markets, marked by their complexity,
multi-agent nature, information asymmetry, and inherent randomness, serve as an
intriguing test-bed for RL. Traditional finance offers certain solutions, and
RL advances these with a more dynamic approach, incorporating machine learning
methods, including transfer learning, meta-learning, and multi-agent solutions.
This survey dissects key RL components through the lens of Quantitative
Finance. We uncover emerging themes, propose areas for future research, and
critique the strengths and weaknesses of existing methods.
