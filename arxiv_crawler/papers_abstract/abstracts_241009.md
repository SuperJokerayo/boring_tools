**Abstract**: Cavitation is a process where bubbles form and collapse within a fluid with
dynamic, spatially varying pressure. This phenomenon can concentrate energy
density by 12 orders of magnitude, creating light-emitting plasma or damaging
nearby surfaces. A key question in cavitation theory and experiments is: what
are the upper limits of energy density achievable through this spontaneous
multiscale process? Among the many physical processes at play, we focus on
fluid compressibility, modeled using the Tait-Murnaghan equation of state for a
homentropic Euler fluid. We examine spherical cavities corresponding to
experimentally realizable sonoluminescing bubbles, whose radius changes by a
factor of over 100. These bubbles reach velocities exceeding the speed of sound
of the surrounding fluid. However, all-Mach hydrodynamic solvers, such as those
implemented using the Basilisk software, can exhibit unphysical behavior even
at early times when motion is nearly incompressible. To accurately capture high
Mach number motion and resolve dynamics in the sonoluminescence regime, we
introduced a uniform bubble approximation for the ideal gas inside the bubble.
This leading-order approximation clarifies the significant effects of
compressibility. Our results reproduce the equation-of-state-dependent
asymptotic power-law region predicted by analytic calculations. This confirms
our method's ability to capture high Mach number motion and suggests that the
asymptotic regime could be experimentally observed. Convergence of this method
is demonstrated for bubbles in both water and liquid lithium, showing that
compressibility slows collapse. Additionally, an outgoing shock wave in the
compressible fluid is resolved.

**Abstract**: The coupling of the Higgs boson to first and second generation fermions has
yet to be measured experimentally. There still could be very large deviations
in these couplings, as the origin of flavor is completely unknown.
Nevertheless, if Yukawa couplings are modified, especially for light
generations, there are generically strong constraints from flavor-changing
neutral currents (FCNCs). Therefore, it is imperative to understand whether
there exists viable UV physics consistent with current data that motivates
future Higgs coupling probes. In particular, the charm-quark Yukawa is the next
quark coupling that could be measured at the LHC if it is a few times larger
than the SM and compatible with flavor data. This is difficult to achieve in
the context of standard ansatz such as Minimal Flavor Violation. In this paper
we show that within the framework of Spontaneous Flavor Violation (SFV), using
a Two Higgs Doublet Model as an example, the Higgs can be sufficiently charming
that new LHC probes are relevant. In this charming region, we show that new
Higgs states near the EW scale with large couplings to quarks are required,
providing complementary observables or new constraints on the SM Yukawa
couplings. The down-type SFV mechanism enabling the suppression of FCNCs also
allows for independent modifications to the up-quark Yukawa coupling, which we
explore in detail as well.

**Abstract**: Quantum error correction (QEC) provides a practical path to fault-tolerant
quantum computing through scaling to large qubit numbers, assuming that
physical errors are sufficiently uncorrelated in time and space. In
superconducting qubit arrays, high-energy impact events produce correlated
errors, violating this key assumption. Following such an event, phonons with
energy above the superconducting gap propagate throughout the device substrate,
which in turn generate a temporary surge in quasiparticle (QP) density
throughout the array. When these QPs tunnel across the qubits' Josephson
junctions, they induce correlated errors. Engineering different superconducting
gaps across the qubit's Josephson junctions provides a method to resist this
form of QP tunneling. By fabricating all-aluminum transmon qubits with both
strong and weak gap engineering on the same substrate, we observe starkly
different responses during high-energy impact events. Strongly gap engineered
qubits do not show any degradation in T1 during impact events, while weakly gap
engineered qubits show events of correlated degradation in T1. We also show
that strongly gap engineered qubits are robust to QP poisoning from increasing
optical illumination intensity, whereas weakly gap engineered qubits display
rapid degradation in coherence. Based on these results, gap engineering removes
the threat of high-energy impacts to QEC in superconducting qubit arrays.

**Abstract**: We consider cosmological models with an arbitrary number of scalar fields
nonminimally coupled to gravity and construct new integrable cosmological
models. In the constructed models, the Ricci scalar is an integral of motion
irrespectively of the type of metric. The general solutions of evolution
equations in the spatially flat FLRW metric have been found for models with the
quartic potentials.

resources and expertise to deliver a high-impact contribution to the
international HEP community.


### Provably Positivity-Preserving Constrained Transport (PPCT) Second-Order Scheme for Ideal Magnetohydrodynamics
**Authors**: Dongwen Pang, Kailiang Wu

**Published Date**: 2024-10-07

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-07

**PDF Url**: [2410.05173v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05173v1)

**Abstract**: This paper proposes and analyzes a robust and efficient second-order
positivity-preserving constrained transport (PPCT) scheme for ideal
magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) on non-staggered Cartesian meshes. The PPCT scheme
ensures two critical physical constraints: a globally discrete divergence-free
(DDF) condition on the magnetic field and the positivity of density and
pressure. The method is inspired by a novel splitting technique from [T.A. Dao,
M. Nazarov and I. Tomas, J. Comput. Phys., 508:113009, 2024], which divides the
MHD system into an Euler subsystem with steady magnetic fields and a magnetic
subsystem with steady density and internal energy. To achieve these
structure-preserving properties, the PPCT scheme combines a
positivity-preserving (PP) finite volume method for the Euler subsystem with a
finite difference constrained transport (CT) method for the magnetic subsystem
via Strang splitting. The finite volume method employs a new PP limiter that
retains second-order accuracy and enforces the positivity of density and
pressure, with rigorous proof provided using the geometric quasilinearization
(GQL) approach [K. Wu and C.-W. Shu, SIAM Review, 65:1031-1073, 2023]. For the
magnetic subsystem, we develop an implicit finite difference CT method that
conserves energy and maintains a globally DDF constraint. This nonlinear system
is efficiently solved to machine precision using an iterative algorithm. Since
the CT method is unconditionally energy-stable and conserves steady density and
internal energy, the PPCT scheme requires only a mild CFL condition for the
finite volume method to ensure stability and the PP property. While the focus
is on 2D cases for clarity, the extension to 3D is discussed. Several
challenging numerical experiments, including highly magnetized MHD jets with
high Mach numbers, validate the PPCT scheme's accuracy, robustness, and high
resolution.


### Hybrid optical sensor for combined thermal and dimensional monitoring in laser processing
**Authors**: Simone Donadello

**Published Date**: 2024-10-07

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-07

**PDF Url**: [2410.05144v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05144v1)

**Abstract**: Optical measurements enable non-contact and high-speed monitoring of physical
processes, offering a non-invasive and versatile approach across a wide range
of fields, from scientific research to industrial applications. In this work,
an optical sensor capable of simultaneously measuring the distance and thermal
emission of surfaces is presented, based on a simple laser diode probe. The
principle of operation integrates triangulation with pyrometry in a single
device, utilizing the monitor photodiode embedded within the probe package. By
alternating the laser emission, the readout can rapidly switch between
dimensional and thermal measurements, resulting in combined data acquisition.
The presented method is compact, easy to integrate, and cost-effective. The
hybrid sensor is implemented into a laser processing setup, where a metallic
target is heated and melted by a high-power laser beam. Its inline operation is
demonstrated in real-time for dynamic measurements of melt pool distance and
radiance. This innovative approach can find applications in diverse fields,
such as remote environmental sensing and closed-loop control systems for
stabilizing high-temperature processes, including laser welding and additive
manufacturing.

**Published Date**: 2024-04-18

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-07

**PDF Url**: [2404.12282v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12282v2)

**Abstract**: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) provide a means of obtaining
approximate solutions of partial differential equations and systems through the
minimisation of an objective function which includes the evaluation of a
residual function at a set of collocation points within the domain. The quality
of a PINNs solution depends upon numerous parameters, including the number and
distribution of these collocation points. In this paper we consider a number of
strategies for selecting these points and investigate their impact on the
overall accuracy of the method. In particular, we suggest that no single
approach is likely to be "optimal" but we show how a number of important
metrics can have an impact in improving the quality of the results obtained
when using a fixed number of residual evaluations. We illustrate these
approaches through the use of two benchmark test problems: Burgers' equation
and the Allen-Cahn equation.


### Solvability of MHS equations with Grad-Rubin boundary conditions in general domains

**PDF Url**: [2410.05119v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05119v1)

**Abstract**: In this paper we study the solvability of the magnetohydrostatic equations
with Grad-Rubin boundary conditions in general domains. Earlier results for
this problem were obtained in the recent years by D. Alonso-Or\'an and J. L. L.
Vel\'azquez, where particularly simple geometries were considered. In this
article we develop a theory that allows to solve these boundary value problems
for a larger class of domains. We will give precise applications to more
physically relevant situations, like the case of the space between two
circumferences or spheres and domains close to them.


### Analyzing the $D^*D^*D^*$ system: Hexaquark states and the Efimov effect

**PDF Url**: [2410.05118v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05118v1)

**Abstract**: In this work we investigate the possible emergence of Efimov states in the
$D^*D^*D^*$ system with $J^P=0^-$ and isospin $I=\tfrac{1}{2}$, assuming the
existence of the heavy partner of the $T_{cc}^+$, dubbed $T_{cc}^*$, near the
$D^*D^*$ threshold as predicted by Heavy-Quark Spin Symmetry. We find that
$(I)J^P=(\frac{1}{2})0^-$ three-body bound states can be formed, with
properties that suggest that the Efimov effect can be realised for reasonable
values of the molecular probability and binding energy of the $T_{cc}^*$.

**Abstract**: Reinforcement learning from human feedback (RLHF) methods are emerging as a
way to fine-tune diffusion models (DMs) for visual generation. However,
commonly used on-policy strategies are limited by the generalization capability
of the reward model, while off-policy approaches require large amounts of
difficult-to-obtain paired human-annotated data, particularly in visual
generation tasks. To address the limitations of both on- and off-policy RLHF,
we propose a preference optimization method that aligns DMs with preferences
without relying on reward models or paired human-annotated data. Specifically,
we introduce a Semi-Policy Preference Optimization (SePPO) method. SePPO
leverages previous checkpoints as reference models while using them to generate
on-policy reference samples, which replace "losing images" in preference pairs.
This approach allows us to optimize using only off-policy "winning images."
Furthermore, we design a strategy for reference model selection that expands
the exploration in the policy space. Notably, we do not simply treat reference
samples as negative examples for learning. Instead, we design an anchor-based
criterion to assess whether the reference samples are likely to be winning or
losing images, allowing the model to selectively learn from the generated
reference samples. This approach mitigates performance degradation caused by
the uncertainty in reference sample quality. We validate SePPO across both
text-to-image and text-to-video benchmarks. SePPO surpasses all previous
approaches on the text-to-image benchmarks and also demonstrates outstanding
performance on the text-to-video benchmarks. Code will be released in
https://github.com/DwanZhang-AI/SePPO.

**PDF Url**: [2410.05167v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05167v1)

**Abstract**: Despite advances in diffusion-based text-to-music (TTM) methods, efficient,
high-quality generation remains a challenge. We introduce Presto!, an approach
to inference acceleration for score-based diffusion transformers via reducing
both sampling steps and cost per step. To reduce steps, we develop a new
score-based distribution matching distillation (DMD) method for the EDM-family
of diffusion models, the first GAN-based distillation method for TTM. To reduce
the cost per step, we develop a simple, but powerful improvement to a recent
layer distillation method that improves learning via better preserving hidden
state variance. Finally, we combine our step and layer distillation methods
together for a dual-faceted approach. We evaluate our step and layer
distillation methods independently and show each yield best-in-class
performance. Our combined distillation method can generate high-quality outputs
with improved diversity, accelerating our base model by 10-18x (230/435ms
latency for 32 second mono/stereo 44.1kHz, 15x faster than comparable SOTA) --
the fastest high-quality TTM to our knowledge. Sound examples can be found at

### A Simulation-Free Deep Learning Approach to Stochastic Optimal Control
**Authors**: Mengjian Hua, Matthieu Laurière, Eric Vanden-Eijnden

**Published Date**: 2024-10-07

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-07

**PDF Url**: [2410.05163v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.05163v1)

**Abstract**: We propose a simulation-free algorithm for the solution of generic problems
in stochastic optimal control (SOC). Unlike existing methods, our approach does
not require the solution of an adjoint problem, but rather leverages Girsanov
theorem to directly calculate the gradient of the SOC objective on-policy. This
allows us to speed up the optimization of control policies parameterized by
neural networks since it completely avoids the expensive back-propagation step
through stochastic differential equations (SDEs) used in the Neural SDE
framework. In particular, it enables us to solve SOC problems in high dimension
and on long time horizons. We demonstrate the efficiency of our approach in
various domains of applications, including standard stochastic optimal control
problems, sampling from unnormalized distributions via construction of a
Schr\"odinger-F\"ollmer process, and fine-tuning of pre-trained diffusion
models. In all cases our method is shown to outperform the existing methods in
both the computing time and memory efficiency.

**Abstract**: Controllable generation through Stable Diffusion (SD) fine-tuning aims to
improve fidelity, safety, and alignment with human guidance. Existing
reinforcement learning from human feedback methods usually rely on predefined
heuristic reward functions or pretrained reward models built on large-scale
datasets, limiting their applicability to scenarios where collecting such data
is costly or difficult. To effectively and efficiently utilize human feedback,
we develop a framework, HERO, which leverages online human feedback collected
on the fly during model learning. Specifically, HERO features two key
mechanisms: (1) Feedback-Aligned Representation Learning, an online training
method that captures human feedback and provides informative learning signals
for fine-tuning, and (2) Feedback-Guided Image Generation, which involves
generating images from SD's refined initialization samples, enabling faster
convergence towards the evaluator's intent. We demonstrate that HERO is 4x more
efficient in online feedback for body part anomaly correction compared to the
best existing method. Additionally, experiments show that HERO can effectively
handle tasks like reasoning, counting, personalization, and reducing NSFW
content with only 0.5K online feedback.


### Autoregressive Image Diffusion: Generation of Image Sequence and Application in MRI

**PDF Url**: [2405.14327v4](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.14327v4)

**Abstract**: Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is a widely used non-invasive imaging
modality. However, a persistent challenge lies in balancing image quality with
imaging speed. This trade-off is primarily constrained by k-space measurements,
which traverse specific trajectories in the spatial Fourier domain (k-space).
These measurements are often undersampled to shorten acquisition times,
resulting in image artifacts and compromised quality. Generative models learn
image distributions and can be used to reconstruct high-quality images from
undersampled k-space data. In this work, we present the autoregressive image
diffusion (AID) model for image sequences and use it to sample the posterior
for accelerated MRI reconstruction. The algorithm incorporates both
undersampled k-space and pre-existing information. Models trained with fastMRI
dataset are evaluated comprehensively. The results show that the AID model can
robustly generate sequentially coherent image sequences. In MRI applications,
the AID can outperform the standard diffusion model and reduce hallucinations,
due to the learned inter-image dependencies. The project code is available at
https://github.com/mrirecon/aid.

**PDF Url**: [2410.04487v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.04487v1)

**Abstract**: We provide a rigorous convergence proof demonstrating that the well-known
semi-analytical Fourier cosine (COS) formula for the inverse Fourier transform
of continuous probability distributions can be extended to discrete probability
distributions, with the help of spectral filters. We establish general
convergence rates for these filters and further show that several classical
spectral filters achieve convergence rates one order faster than previously
recognized in the literature on the Gibbs phenomenon. Our numerical experiments
corroborate the theoretical convergence results. Additionally, we illustrate
the computational speed and accuracy of the discrete COS method with
applications in computational statistics and quantitative finance. The
theoretical and numerical results highlight the method's potential for solving
problems involving discrete distributions, particularly when the characteristic
function is known, allowing the discrete Fourier transform (DFT) to be
bypassed.
