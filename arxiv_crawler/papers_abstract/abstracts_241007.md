**Abstract**: Physicists routinely need probabilistic models for a number of tasks such as
parameter inference or the generation of new realizations of a field.
Establishing such models for highly non-Gaussian fields is a challenge,
especially when the number of samples is limited. In this paper, we introduce
scattering spectra models for stationary fields and we show that they provide
accurate and robust statistical descriptions of a wide range of fields
encountered in physics. These models are based on covariances of scattering
coefficients, i.e. wavelet decomposition of a field coupled with a point-wise
modulus. After introducing useful dimension reductions taking advantage of the
regularity of a field under rotation and scaling, we validate these models on
various multi-scale physical fields and demonstrate that they reproduce
standard statistics, including spatial moments up to 4th order. These
scattering spectra provide us with a low-dimensional structured representation
that captures key properties encountered in a wide range of physical fields.
These generic models can be used for data exploration, classification,
parameter inference, symmetry detection, and component separation.

**Abstract**: We prove global existence and decay for small-data solutions to a class of
quasilinear wave equations on a wide variety of asymptotically flat spacetime
backgrounds, allowing in particular for the presence of horizons, ergoregions
and trapped null geodesics, and including as a special case the Schwarzschild
and very slowly rotating $\vert a \vert \ll M$ Kerr family of black holes in
general relativity. There are two distinguishing aspects of our approach. The
first aspect is its dyadically localised nature: The nontrivial part of the
analysis is reduced entirely to time-translation invariant $r^p$-weighted
estimates, in the spirit of [DR09], to be applied on dyadic time-slabs which
for large $r$ are outgoing. Global existence and decay then both immediately
follow by elementary iteration on consecutive such time-slabs, without further
global bootstrap. The second, and more fundamental, aspect is our direct use of
a "blackbox" linear inhomogeneous energy estimate on exactly stationary
metrics, together with a novel but elementary physical space top order identity
that need not capture the structure of trapping and is robust to perturbation.
In the specific example of Kerr black holes, the required linear inhomogeneous
estimate can then be quoted directly from the literature [DRSR16], while the
additional top order physical space identity can be shown easily in many cases
(we include in the Appendix a proof for the Kerr case $\vert a \vert \ll M$,
which can in fact be understood in this context simply as a perturbation of
Schwarzschild). In particular, the approach circumvents the need either for
producing a purely physical space identity capturing trapping or for a careful
analysis of the commutation properties of frequency projections with the wave
operator of time-dependent metrics.


### Quasilinear wave equations on Kerr black holes in the full subextremal range $|a|<M$

**PDF Url**: [2410.03639v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03639v1)

**Abstract**: We prove global existence, boundedness and decay for small data solutions
$\psi$ to a general class of quasilinear wave equations on Kerr black hole
backgrounds in the full sub-extremal range $|a|<M$. The method extends our
previous [DHRT22], which considered such equations on a wide class of
background spacetimes, including Kerr, but restricted in that case to the very
slowly rotating regime $|a|\ll M$ (which may be treated simply as a
perturbation of Schwarzschild $a=0$). To handle the general $|a|<M$ case, our
present proof is based on two ingredients: (i) the linear inhomogeneous
estimates on Kerr backgrounds proven in [DRSR16], further refined however in
order to gain a derivative in elliptic frequency regimes, and (ii) the
existence of appropriate physical space currents satisfying degenerate
coercivity properties, but which now must be tailored to a finite number of
wave packets defined by suitable frequency projection. The above ingredients
can be thought of as adaptations of the two basic ingredients of [DHRT22],
exploiting however the peculiarities of the Kerr geometry. The novel frequency
decomposition in (ii), inspired by the boundedness arguments of [DR11, DRSR16],
is defined using only azimuthal and stationary frequencies, and serves both to
separate the superradiant and non-superradiant parts of the solution and to
localise trapping to small regions of spacetime. The strengthened (i), on the
other hand, allows us to relax the required coercivity properties of our
wave-packet dependent currents, so as in particular to accept top order errors
provided that they are localised to the elliptic frequency regime. These error
terms are analysed with the help of the full Carter separation.

**PDF Url**: [2410.03631v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03631v1)

**Abstract**: Resonances, also known as quasi normal modes (QNM) in the non-Hermitian case,
play an ubiquitous role in all domains of physics ruled by wave phenomena,
notably in continuum mechanics, acoustics, electrodynamics, and quantum theory.
In this paper, we present a QNM expansion for dispersive systems, recently
applied to photonics but based on sixty year old techniques in mechanics. The
resulting numerical algorithm appears to be physically agnostic, that is
independent of the considered physical problem and can therefore be implemented
as a mere toolbox in a nonlinear eigenvalue computation library.

**Abstract**: The detailed structure of the peaks appearing in the density-density
correlation function for an acoustic black hole formed by a Bose-Einstein
condensate is analytically discussed for a particular, but physically
meaningful, sound velocity profile that allows the field modes to be exactly
computed.


### A concept of a para-hydrogen-based cold neutron source for simultaneous high flux and high brightness
**Authors**: Alexander Ioffe, Petr Konik, Konstantin Batkov

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-04

**PDF Url**: [2311.15389v7](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.15389v7)

**Abstract**: A novel cold neutron source (CNS) employing chessboard or staircase
assemblies of high-aspect ratio rectangular (HARR) para-hydrogen (p-H2)
moderators is proposed. It is demonstrated that this design can generate
neutron beams with higher intensity and brightness, up to 2.5 times more than
any p-H2 based CNS with an equal cold neutron beam cross-section made of a
single moderator (flat or voluminous). Two limiting factors for this gain are
identified: the limited volume of the high-density thermal neutron region
surrounding the reactor core or spallation target imposing constraints on the
total length of the moderator assembly and the finite width of moderator walls.
Additional factors affecting gain can be revealed by dedicated Monte Carlo
simulations of the moderator-reflector assembly, which can only be conducted
for a particular neutron source and are beyond the scope of this general study.
Moreover, the relatively large length of moderator assemblies makes their
application for short pulse neutron sources very problematic. Analytic approach
for calculating the brightness of p-H2 moderators is introduced. Because
brightness gain originates from a near-the-surface effect resulting from the
prevailing single collision process, HARR CMs offer a significant increase, up
to a factor of 10, in cold neutron brightness. The obtained results are in
excellent agreement with MCNP calculations. The concept of 'low-dimensionality'
(low-d) in moderators is explored: achieving a substantial increase in
brightness necessitates CMs to be low-d both geometrically (HARR) and
physically, requiring the moderator's smallest dimension to be smaller than the
mean free path for thermal neutrons. This explains why additional compression
of the CM along the longest direction, effectively giving it a tube-like shape,
does not leads to a significant brightness increase comparable to the
flattening of CM.


### LInK: Learning Joint Representations of Design and Performance Spaces through Contrastive Learning for Mechanism Synthesis
**Authors**: Amin Heyrani Nobari, Akash Srivastava, Dan Gutfreund, Kai Xu, Faez Ahmed

**Published Date**: 2024-05-31

**PDF Url**: [2405.20592v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20592v2)

**Abstract**: In this paper, we introduce LInK, a novel framework that integrates
contrastive learning of performance and design space with optimization
techniques for solving complex inverse problems in engineering design with
discrete and continuous variables. We focus on the path synthesis problem for
planar linkage mechanisms. By leveraging a multimodal and
transformation-invariant contrastive learning framework, LInK learns a joint
representation that captures complex physics and design representations of
mechanisms, enabling rapid retrieval from a vast dataset of over 10 million
mechanisms. This approach improves precision through the warm start of a
hierarchical unconstrained nonlinear optimization algorithm, combining the
robustness of traditional optimization with the speed and adaptability of
modern deep learning methods. Our results on an existing benchmark demonstrate
that LInK outperforms existing methods with 28 times less error compared to a
state of the art approach while taking 20 times less time on an existing
benchmark. Moreover, we introduce a significantly more challenging benchmark,
named LINK ABC, which involves synthesizing linkages that trace the
trajectories of English capital alphabets, an inverse design benchmark task
that existing methods struggle with due to large nonlinearities and tiny
feasible space. Our results demonstrate that LInK not only advances the field
of mechanism design but also broadens the applicability of contrastive learning
and optimization to other areas of engineering. The code and data are publicly

### Language Model Empowered Spatio-Temporal Forecasting via Physics-Aware Reprogramming
**Authors**: Hao Wang, Jindong Han, Wei Fan, Hao Liu

**Published Date**: 2024-08-24

**PDF Url**: [2408.14505v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.14505v2)

**Abstract**: Spatio-temporal forecasting is pivotal in numerous real-world applications,
including transportation planning, energy management, and climate monitoring.
In this work, we aim to harness the reasoning and generalization abilities of
Pre-trained Language Models (PLMs) for more effective spatio-temporal
forecasting, particularly in data-scarce scenarios. However, recent studies
uncover that PLMs, which are primarily trained on textual data, often falter
when tasked with modeling the intricate correlations in numerical time series,
thereby limiting their effectiveness in comprehending spatio-temporal data. To
bridge the gap, we propose RePST, a physics-aware PLM reprogramming framework
tailored for spatio-temporal forecasting. Specifically, we first propose a
physics-aware decomposer that adaptively disentangles spatially correlated time
series into interpretable sub-components, which facilitates PLM to understand
sophisticated spatio-temporal dynamics via a divide-and-conquer strategy.
Moreover, we propose a selective discrete reprogramming scheme, which
introduces an expanded spatio-temporal vocabulary space to project
spatio-temporal series into discrete representations. This scheme minimizes the
information loss during reprogramming and enriches the representations derived
by PLMs. Extensive experiments on real-world datasets show that the proposed
RePST outperforms twelve state-of-the-art baseline methods, particularly in
data-scarce scenarios, highlighting the effectiveness and superior
generalization capabilities of PLMs for spatio-temporal forecasting.


### BRST Covariant Phase Space and Holographic Ward Identities
**Authors**: Laurent Baulieu, Tom Wetzstein

**Published Date**: 2024-05-29

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-04

**PDF Url**: [2405.18898v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.18898v3)

**Abstract**: This paper develops an enlarged BRST framework to treat the large gauge
transformations of a given quantum field theory. It determines the associated
infinitely many Noether charges stemming from a gauge fixed and BRST invariant
Lagrangian, a result that cannot be obtained from Noether's second theorem. The
geometrical significance of this result is highlighted by the construction of a
trigraded BRST covariant phase space, allowing a BRST invariant gauge fixing
procedure. This provides an appropriate framework for determining the conserved
BRST Noether current of the global BRST symmetry and the associated global
Noether charges. The latter are found to be equivalent with the usual classical
corner charges of large gauge transformations. It allows one to prove the gauge
independence of their physical effects at the perturbative quantum level. In
particular, the underlying BRST fundamental canonical relation provides the
same graded symplectic brackets as in the classical covariant phase space. A
unified Lagrangian Ward identity for small and large gauge transformations is
built. It consistently decouples into a bulk part for small gauge
transformations, which is the standard BRST--BV quantum master equation, and a
boundary part for large gauge transformations. The boundary part provides a
perturbation theory origin for the invariance of the Hamiltonian physical
$\mathcal{S}$-matrix under asymptotic symmetries. Holographic anomalies for the
boundary Ward identity are studied and found to be solutions of a codimension
one Wess--Zumino consistency condition. Such solutions are studied in the
context of extended BMS symmetry. Their existence clarifies the status of the
$1$-loop correction to the subleading soft graviton theorem.


### HyResPINNs: Adaptive Hybrid Residual Networks for Learning Optimal Combinations of Neural and RBF Components for Physics-Informed Modeling
**Authors**: Madison Cooley, Robert M. Kirby, Shandian Zhe, Varun Shankar

**PDF Url**: [2410.03573v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03573v1)

**Abstract**: Physics-informed neural networks (PINNs) are an increasingly popular class of
techniques for the numerical solution of partial differential equations (PDEs),
where neural networks are trained using loss functions regularized by relevant
PDE terms to enforce physical constraints. We present a new class of PINNs
called HyResPINNs, which augment traditional PINNs with adaptive hybrid
residual blocks that combine the outputs of a standard neural network and a
radial basis function (RBF) network. A key feature of our method is the
inclusion of adaptive combination parameters within each residual block, which
dynamically learn to weigh the contributions of the neural network and RBF
network outputs. Additionally, adaptive connections between residual blocks
allow for flexible information flow throughout the network. We show that
HyResPINNs are more robust to training point locations and neural network
architectures than traditional PINNs. Moreover, HyResPINNs offer orders of
magnitude greater accuracy than competing methods on certain problems, with
only modest increases in training costs. We demonstrate the strengths of our
approach on challenging PDEs, including the Allen-Cahn equation and the
Darcy-Flow equation. Our results suggest that HyResPINNs effectively bridge the
gap between traditional numerical methods and modern machine learning-based
solvers.


## Diffusion
### Estimating Body and Hand Motion in an Ego-sensed World
**Authors**: Brent Yi, Vickie Ye, Maya Zheng, Lea Müller, Georgios Pavlakos, Yi Ma, Jitendra Malik, Angjoo Kanazawa

**PDF Url**: [2410.03665v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03665v1)

**Abstract**: We present EgoAllo, a system for human motion estimation from a head-mounted
device. Using only egocentric SLAM poses and images, EgoAllo guides sampling
from a conditional diffusion model to estimate 3D body pose, height, and hand
parameters that capture the wearer's actions in the allocentric coordinate
frame of the scene. To achieve this, our key insight is in representation: we
propose spatial and temporal invariance criteria for improving model
performance, from which we derive a head motion conditioning parameterization
that improves estimation by up to 18%. We also show how the bodies estimated by
our system can improve the hands: the resulting kinematic and temporal
constraints result in over 40% lower hand estimation errors compared to noisy
monocular estimates. Project page: https://egoallo.github.io/


### Geometric Representation Condition Improves Equivariant Molecule Generation

**Abstract**: Recent advancements in molecular generative models have demonstrated
substantial potential in accelerating scientific discovery, particularly in
drug design. However, these models often face challenges in generating
high-quality molecules, especially in conditional scenarios where specific
molecular properties must be satisfied. In this work, we introduce GeoRCG, a
general framework to enhance the performance of molecular generative models by
integrating geometric representation conditions. We decompose the molecule
generation process into two stages: first, generating an informative geometric
representation; second, generating a molecule conditioned on the
representation. Compared to directly generating a molecule, the relatively
easy-to-generate representation in the first-stage guides the second-stage
generation to reach a high-quality molecule in a more goal-oriented and much
faster way. Leveraging EDM as the base generator, we observe significant
quality improvements in unconditional molecule generation on the widely-used
QM9 and GEOM-DRUG datasets. More notably, in the challenging conditional
molecular generation task, our framework achieves an average 31\% performance
improvement over state-of-the-art approaches, highlighting the superiority of
conditioning on semantically rich geometric representations over conditioning
on individual property values as in previous approaches. Furthermore, we show
that, with such representation guidance, the number of diffusion steps can be
reduced to as small as 100 while maintaining superior generation quality than
that achieved with 1,000 steps, thereby significantly accelerating the
generation process.


### Real-World Benchmarks Make Membership Inference Attacks Fail on Diffusion Models

**PDF Url**: [2410.03640v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03640v1)

**Abstract**: Membership inference attacks (MIAs) on diffusion models have emerged as
potential evidence of unauthorized data usage in training pre-trained diffusion
models. These attacks aim to detect the presence of specific images in training
datasets of diffusion models. Our study delves into the evaluation of
state-of-the-art MIAs on diffusion models and reveals critical flaws and overly
optimistic performance estimates in existing MIA evaluation. We introduce
CopyMark, a more realistic MIA benchmark that distinguishes itself through the
support for pre-trained diffusion models, unbiased datasets, and fair
evaluation pipelines. Through extensive experiments, we demonstrate that the
effectiveness of current MIA methods significantly degrades under these more
practical conditions. Based on our results, we alert that MIA, in its current
state, is not a reliable approach for identifying unauthorized data usage in
pre-trained diffusion models. To the best of our knowledge, we are the first to
discover the performance overestimation of MIAs on diffusion models and present
a unified benchmark for more realistic evaluation. Our code is available on
GitHub: \url{https://github.com/caradryanl/CopyMark}.


### AID: Attention Interpolation of Text-to-Image Diffusion

**PDF Url**: [2403.17924v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17924v3)

**Abstract**: Conditional diffusion models can create unseen images in various settings,
aiding image interpolation. Interpolation in latent spaces is well-studied, but
interpolation with specific conditions like text or poses is less understood.
Simple approaches, such as linear interpolation in the space of conditions,
often result in images that lack consistency, smoothness, and fidelity. To that
end, we introduce a novel training-free technique named Attention Interpolation
via Diffusion (AID). Our key contributions include 1) proposing an inner/outer
interpolated attention layer; 2) fusing the interpolated attention with
self-attention to boost fidelity; and 3) applying beta distribution to
selection to increase smoothness. We also present a variant, Prompt-guided
Attention Interpolation via Diffusion (PAID), that considers interpolation as a
condition-dependent generative process. This method enables the creation of new
images with greater consistency, smoothness, and efficiency, and offers control
over the exact path of interpolation. Our approach demonstrates effectiveness
for conceptual and spatial interpolation. Code and demo are available at
https://github.com/QY-H00/attention-interpolation-diffusion.


### How Discrete and Continuous Diffusion Meet: Comprehensive Analysis of Discrete Diffusion Models via a Stochastic Integral Framework

**Updated Date**: 2024-10-04

**PDF Url**: [2410.03601v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.03601v1)

**Abstract**: Discrete diffusion models have gained increasing attention for their ability
to model complex distributions with tractable sampling and inference. However,
the error analysis for discrete diffusion models remains less well-understood.
In this work, we propose a comprehensive framework for the error analysis of
discrete diffusion models based on L\'evy-type stochastic integrals. By
generalizing the Poisson random measure to that with a time-independent and
state-dependent intensity, we rigorously establish a stochastic integral
formulation of discrete diffusion models and provide the corresponding change
of measure theorems that are intriguingly analogous to It\^o integrals and
Girsanov's theorem for their continuous counterparts. Our framework unifies and
strengthens the current theoretical results on discrete diffusion models and
obtains the first error bound for the $\tau$-leaping scheme in KL divergence.
With error sources clearly identified, our analysis gives new insight into the
mathematical properties of discrete diffusion models and offers guidance for
the design of efficient and accurate algorithms for real-world discrete
diffusion model applications.
