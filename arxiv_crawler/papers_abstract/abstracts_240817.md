**Abstract**: In this letter, we demonstrate how an emergent non-invertible symmetry along
a renormalization group (RG) flow reveals connections between microscopic and
macroscopic physics. We illustrate this using (3+1)-dimensional Adjoint QCD
with two flavors of Weyl fermions as an example. For the $\mathrm{SU}(2)$ case,
C\'ordova and Dumitrescu proposed a non-supersymmetric deformation of the
$\mathcal{N}=2$ SYM theory leading to dynamical abelianization, followed by
monopole condensation, and resulting in a confining infrared (IR) phase
characterized by disjoint copies of the $\mathbb{CP}^1$ sigma model. In this
scenario, we point out that the abelianized phase has an emergent
non-invertible symmetry, which is matched with the non-invertible symmetry of
the IR $\mathbb{CP}^1$ phase, associated to the Hopf solitons. This result
illustrate how an emergent non-invertible symmetry can be used to provide a
bridge connecting the IR solitons and their properties with the ones of
microscopic degrees of freedom in gauge theories with one-form symmetries.
Moreover, based on this insight we generalize these results to other gauge
theories with any number of colors, and propose a candidate for the UV baryon
operator in all these cases.

**Abstract**: Quantum computers must achieve large-scale, fault-tolerant operation to
deliver on their promise of transformational processing power [1-4]. This will
require thousands or millions of high-fidelity quantum gates and similar
numbers of qubits [5]. Demonstrations using neutral-atom qubits trapped and
manipulated by lasers have shown that this modality can provide high two-qubit
gate (CZ) fidelities and scalable operation [6-10]. However, the gates in these
demonstrations are driven by lasers that do not resolve individual qubits, with
universal computation enabled by physical mid-circuit shuttling of the qubits.
This relatively slow operation will greatly extend runtimes for useful,
large-scale computation. Here we demonstrate a universal neutral-atom quantum
computer with gate rates limited by optical switching times, rather than
shuttling, by individually addressing tightly focused laser beams at an array
of single atoms. We achieve CZ fidelity of 99.35(4)% and local single qubit RZ
gate fidelity of 99.902(8)%. Moreover, we demonstrate non-destructive readout
of alkali-atom qubits with sub-percent loss, which boosts operational speed.
This technique also enables us to measure 99.73(3)% CZ fidelity with atom-loss
events excluded, which is a record among long lived neutral-atom qubits and
highlights the path to higher fidelity and error correction. Our results
represent a critical step towards large-scale, fault-tolerant neutral-atom
quantum computers that can execute computations on practical timescales.

**Abstract**: Gauge PDEs generalise AKSZ sigma models to the case of general local gauge
theories. Despite being very flexible and invariant these geometrical objects
are usually infinite-dimensional and are difficult to define explicitly, just
like standard infinitely-prolonged PDEs. We propose a notion of a weak gauge
PDE where the nilpotency of the BRST differential is relaxed in a controllable
way. In this approach a nontopological local gauge theory can be described in
terms of a finite-dimensional geometrical object. Moreover, among such objects
one can find a minimal one which is unique in a certain sense. In the case of a
Lagrangian system, the respective weak gauge PDE naturally arise from its weak
presymplectic formulation. We prove that any weak gauge PDE determines the
standard jet-bundle BV formulation of the underlying gauge theory, giving an
unambiguous physical interpretation of these objects. The formalism is
illustrated by a few examples including the non-Lagrangian self-dual Yang-Mills
theory. We also discuss possible applications of the approach to
characterisation of those infinite-dimensional gauge PDEs which correspond to
local theories.

**Abstract**: Most present stellarator designs are produced by costly two-stage
optimization: the first for an optimized equilibrium, and the second for a coil
design reproducing its magnetic configuration. Few proxies for coil complexity
and forces exist at the equilibrium stage. Rapid initial state finding for both
stages is a topic of active research. Most present convex coil optimization
codes use the least square winding surface method by Merkel (NESCOIL), with
recent improvement in conditioning, regularization , sparsity and physics
objectives. While elegant, the method is limited to modeling the norms of
linear functions in coil current. We present QUADCOIL, a fast, global coil
optimization method that targets combinations of linear and quadratic functions
of the current. It can directly constrain and/or minimize a wide range of
physics objectives unavailable in NESCOIL and REGCOIL, including the Lorentz
force, magnetic energy, curvature, field-current alignment, and the maximum
density of a dipole array. QUADCOIL requires no initial guess and runs nearly
$10^2\times$ faster than filament optimization. Integrating it in the
equilibrium optimization stage can potentially exclude equilibria with
difficult-to-design coils, without significantly increasing the computation
time per iteration. QUADCOIL finds the exact, global minimum in a large
parameter space when possible, and otherwise finds a well-performing
approximate global minimum. It supports most regularization techniques
developed for NESCOIL and REGCOIL. We demonstrate QUADCOIL's effectiveness in
coil topology control, minimizing non-convex penalties, and predicting filament
coil complexity with three numerical examples.

**Abstract**: The JETSCAPE Collaboration reports a new determination of the jet transport
parameter $\hat{q}$ in the Quark-Gluon Plasma (QGP) using Bayesian Inference,
incorporating all available inclusive hadron and jet yield suppression data
measured in heavy-ion collisions at RHIC and the LHC. This multi-observable
analysis extends the previously published JETSCAPE Bayesian Inference
determination of $\hat{q}$, which was based solely on a selection of inclusive
hadron suppression data. JETSCAPE is a modular framework incorporating detailed
dynamical models of QGP formation and evolution, and jet propagation and
interaction in the QGP. Virtuality-dependent partonic energy loss in the QGP is
modeled as a thermalized weakly-coupled plasma, with parameters determined from
Bayesian calibration using soft-sector observables. This Bayesian calibration
of $\hat{q}$ utilizes Active Learning, a machine--learning approach, for
efficient exploitation of computing resources. The experimental data included
in this analysis span a broad range in collision energy and centrality, and in
transverse momentum. In order to explore the systematic dependence of the
extracted parameter posterior distributions, several different calibrations are
reported, based on combined jet and hadron data; on jet or hadron data
separately; and on restricted kinematic or centrality ranges of the jet and
hadron data. Tension is observed in comparison of these variations, providing
new insights into the physics of jet transport in the QGP and its theoretical
formulation.

**Abstract**: Recently emerged as a disruptive networking paradigm, quantum networks rely
on the mysterious quantum entanglement to teleport qubits without physically
transferring quantum particles. However, the state of quantum systems is
extremely fragile due to environment noise. A promising technique to combat
against quantum decoherence is entanglement purification. To fully exploit its
benefit, two fundamental research questions need to be answered: (1) given an
entanglement path, what is the optimal entanglement purification schedule? (2)
how to compute min-cost end-to-end entanglement paths subject to fidelity
constraint? In this paper, we give algorithmic solutions to both questions. For
the first question, we develop an optimal entanglement purification scheduling
algorithm for the single-hop case and analyze the \textsc{purify-and-swap}
strategy in the multi-hop case by establishing the closed-form condition for
its optimality. For the second question, we design a polynomial-time algorithm
constructing an $\epsilon$-optimal fidelity-constrained path. The effectiveness
of our algorithms are also numerically demonstrated by extensive simulations.

**Abstract**: Embodied artificial intelligence (AI) represents an artificial intelligence
system that interacts with the physical world through sensors and actuators,
seamlessly integrating perception and action. This design enables AI to learn
from and operate within complex, real-world environments. Large Language Models
(LLMs) deeply explore language instructions, playing a crucial role in devising
plans for complex tasks. Consequently, they have progressively shown immense
potential in empowering embodied AI, with LLM-based embodied AI emerging as a
focal point of research within the community. It is foreseeable that, over the
next decade, LLM-based embodied AI robots are expected to proliferate widely,
becoming commonplace in homes and industries. However, a critical safety issue
that has long been hiding in plain sight is: could LLM-based embodied AI
perpetrate harmful behaviors? Our research investigates for the first time how
to induce threatening actions in embodied AI, confirming the severe risks posed
by these soon-to-be-marketed robots, which starkly contravene Asimov's Three
Laws of Robotics and threaten human safety. Specifically, we formulate the
concept of embodied AI jailbreaking and expose three critical security
vulnerabilities: first, jailbreaking robotics through compromised LLM; second,
safety misalignment between action and language spaces; and third, deceptive
prompts leading to unaware hazardous behaviors. We also analyze potential
mitigation measures and advocate for community awareness regarding the safety
of embodied AI applications in the physical world.

**Abstract**: Image-to-Image translation in Generative Artificial Intelligence (Generative
AI) has been a central focus of research, with applications spanning
healthcare, remote sensing, physics, chemistry, photography, and more. Among
the numerous methodologies, Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) with
contrastive learning have been particularly successful. This study aims to
demonstrate that the Kolmogorov-Arnold Network (KAN) can effectively replace
the Multi-layer Perceptron (MLP) method in generative AI, particularly in the
subdomain of image-to-image translation, to achieve better generative quality.
Our novel approach replaces the two-layer MLP with a two-layer KAN in the
existing Contrastive Unpaired Image-to-Image Translation (CUT) model,
developing the KAN-CUT model. This substitution favors the generation of more
informative features in low-dimensional vector representations, which
contrastive learning can utilize more effectively to produce high-quality
images in the target domain. Extensive experiments, detailed in the results
section, demonstrate the applicability of KAN in conjunction with contrastive
learning and GANs in Generative AI, particularly for image-to-image
translation. This work suggests that KAN could be a valuable component in the
broader generative AI domain.


### Scalar-Scaffolded Gluons and the Combinatorial Origins of Yang-Mills Theory

**Abstract**: We present a new formulation for Yang-Mills scattering amplitudes in any
number of dimensions and at any loop order, based on the same combinatorial and
binary-geometric ideas in kinematic space recently used to give an all-order
description of Tr $\phi^3$ theory. We propose that in a precise sense the
amplitudes for a suitably "stringy" form of these two theories are identical,
up to a simple shift of kinematic variables. This connection is made possible
by describing the amplitudes for $n$ gluons via a "scalar scaffolding", arising
from the scattering of $2n$ colored scalars coming in $n$ distinct pairs of
flavors fusing to produce the gluons. Fundamental properties of the
"$u$-variables", describing the "binary geometry" for surfaces appearing in the
topological expansion, magically guarantee that the kinematically shifted Tr
$\phi^3$ amplitudes satisfy the physical properties needed to be interpreted as
scaffolded gluons. These include multilinearity, gauge invariance, and
factorization on tree- and loop- level gluon cuts. Our "stringy" scaffolded
gluon amplitudes coincide with amplitudes in the bosonic string for
extra-dimensional gluon polarizations at tree-level, but differ (and are
simpler) at loop-level. We provide many checks on our proposal, including
matching non-trivial leading singularities through two loops. The simple
counting problem underlying the $u$ variables autonomously "knows" about
everything needed to convert colored scalar to gluon amplitudes, exposing a
striking "discovery" of Yang-Mills amplitudes from elementary combinatorial
ideas in kinematic space.

**Abstract**: Conventional physics-based modeling techniques involve high effort, e.g.,
time and expert knowledge, while data-driven methods often lack
interpretability, structure, and sometimes reliability. To mitigate this, we
present a data-driven system identification framework that derives models in
the port-Hamiltonian (pH) formulation. This formulation is suitable for
multi-physical systems while guaranteeing the useful system theoretical
properties of passivity and stability. Our framework combines linear and
nonlinear reduction with structured, physics-motivated system identification.
In this process, high-dimensional state data obtained from possibly nonlinear
systems serves as input for an autoencoder, which then performs two tasks: (i)
nonlinearly transforming and (ii) reducing this data onto a low-dimensional
latent space. In this space, a linear pH system, that satisfies the pH
properties per construction, is parameterized by the weights of a neural
network. The mathematical requirements are met by defining the pH matrices
through Cholesky factorizations. The neural networks that define the coordinate
transformation and the pH system are identified in a joint optimization process
to match the dynamics observed in the data while defining a linear pH system in
the latent space. The learned, low-dimensional pH system can describe even
nonlinear systems and is rapidly computable due to its small size. The method
is exemplified by a parametric mass-spring-damper and a nonlinear pendulum
example, as well as the high-dimensional model of a disc brake with linear
thermoelastic behavior.

**Abstract**: Deep generative models learn continuous representations of complex data
manifolds using a finite number of samples during training. For a pre-trained
generative model, the common way to evaluate the quality of the manifold
representation learned, is by computing global metrics like Fr\'echet Inception
Distance using a large number of generated and real samples. However,
generative model performance is not uniform across the learned manifold, e.g.,
for \textit{foundation models} like Stable Diffusion generation performance can
vary significantly based on the conditioning or initial noise vector being
denoised. In this paper we study the relationship between the \textit{local
geometry of the learned manifold} and downstream generation. Based on the
theory of continuous piecewise-linear (CPWL) generators, we use three geometric
descriptors - scaling ($\psi$), rank ($\nu$), and complexity ($\delta$) - to
characterize a pre-trained generative model manifold locally. We provide
quantitative and qualitative evidence showing that for a given latent, the
local descriptors are correlated with generation aesthetics, artifacts,
uncertainty, and even memorization. Finally we demonstrate that training a
\textit{reward model} on the local geometry can allow controlling the
likelihood of a generated sample under the learned distribution.

**Abstract**: Diffusion models excel at capturing the natural design spaces of images,
molecules, DNA, RNA, and protein sequences. However, rather than merely
generating designs that are natural, we often aim to optimize downstream reward
functions while preserving the naturalness of these design spaces. Existing
methods for achieving this goal often require ``differentiable'' proxy models
(\textit{e.g.}, classifier guidance or DPS) or involve computationally
expensive fine-tuning of diffusion models (\textit{e.g.}, classifier-free
guidance, RL-based fine-tuning). In our work, we propose a new method to
address these challenges. Our algorithm is an iterative sampling method that
integrates soft value functions, which looks ahead to how intermediate noisy
states lead to high rewards in the future, into the standard inference
procedure of pre-trained diffusion models. Notably, our approach avoids
fine-tuning generative models and eliminates the need to construct
differentiable models. This enables us to (1) directly utilize
non-differentiable features/reward feedback, commonly used in many scientific
domains, and (2) apply our method to recent discrete diffusion models in a
principled way. Finally, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our algorithm
across several domains, including image generation, molecule generation, and
DNA/RNA sequence generation. The code is available at

**Abstract**: This work addresses the challenge of quantifying originality in text-to-image
(T2I) generative diffusion models, with a focus on copyright originality. We
begin by evaluating T2I models' ability to innovate and generalize through
controlled experiments, revealing that stable diffusion models can effectively
recreate unseen elements with sufficiently diverse training data. Then, our key
insight is that concepts and combinations of image elements the model is
familiar with, and saw more during training, are more concisly represented in
the model's latent space. We hence propose a method that leverages textual
inversion to measure the originality of an image based on the number of tokens
required for its reconstruction by the model. Our approach is inspired by legal
definitions of originality and aims to assess whether a model can produce
original content without relying on specific prompts or having the training
data of the model. We demonstrate our method using both a pre-trained stable
diffusion model and a synthetic dataset, showing a correlation between the
number of tokens and image originality. This work contributes to the
understanding of originality in generative models and has implications for
copyright infringement cases.

**Abstract**: Real-time character control is an essential component for interactive
experiences, with a broad range of applications, including physics simulations,
video games, and virtual reality. The success of diffusion models for image
synthesis has led to the use of these models for motion synthesis. However, the
majority of these motion diffusion models are primarily designed for offline
applications, where space-time models are used to synthesize an entire sequence
of frames simultaneously with a pre-specified length. To enable real-time
motion synthesis with diffusion model that allows time-varying controls, we
propose A-MDM (Auto-regressive Motion Diffusion Model). Our conditional
diffusion model takes an initial pose as input, and auto-regressively generates
successive motion frames conditioned on the previous frame. Despite its
streamlined network architecture, which uses simple MLPs, our framework is
capable of generating diverse, long-horizon, and high-fidelity motion
sequences. Furthermore, we introduce a suite of techniques for incorporating
interactive controls into A-MDM, such as task-oriented sampling, in-painting,
and hierarchical reinforcement learning. These techniques enable a pre-trained
A-MDM to be efficiently adapted for a variety of new downstream tasks. We
conduct a comprehensive suite of experiments to demonstrate the effectiveness
of A-MDM, and compare its performance against state-of-the-art auto-regressive
methods.

**Abstract**: Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) imaging technology provides the unique
advantage of being able to collect data regardless of weather conditions and
time. However, SAR images exhibit complex backscatter patterns and speckle
noise, which necessitate expertise for interpretation. To deal with this
challenge, research has been conducted on translating SAR images into
optical-like representations to aid the interpretation of SAR data.
Nevertheless, existing studies have predominantly utilized low-resolution
satellite imagery datasets and have largely been based on Generative
Adversarial Network (GAN) which are known for their training instability and
low fidelity. To overcome these limitations of low-resolution data usage and
GAN-based approaches, this paper introduces a conditional image-to-image
translation approach based on Brownian Bridge Diffusion Model (BBDM). We
conducted comprehensive experiments on the MSAW dataset, a paired SAR and
optical images collection of 0.5m Very-High-Resolution (VHR) images. The
experimental results indicate that our method surpasses both the Conditional
Diffusion Model (CDM) and the GAN-based models in diverse perceptual quality
metrics.
