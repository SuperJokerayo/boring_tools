**Abstract**: Charged particle reconstruction is one the most computationally heavy
components of the full event reconstruction of Large Hadron Collider (LHC)
experiments. Looking to the future, projections for the High Luminosity LHC
(HL-LHC) indicate a superlinear growth for required computing resources for
single-threaded CPU algorithms that surpass the computing resources that are
expected to be available. The combination of these facts creates the need for
efficient and computationally performant pattern recognition algorithms that
will be able to run in parallel and possibly on other hardware, such as GPUs,
given that these become more and more available in LHC experiments and
high-performance computing centres. Line Segment Tracking (LST) is a novel such
algorithm which has been developed to be fully parallelizable and hardware
agnostic. The latter is achieved through the usage of the Alpaka library. The
LST algorithm has been tested with the CMS central software as an external
package and has been used in the context of the CMS HL-LHC High Level Trigger
(HLT). When employing LST for pattern recognition in the HLT tracking, the
physics and timing performances are shown to improve with respect to the ones
utilizing the current pattern recognition algorithms. The latest results on the
usage of the LST algorithm within the CMS HL-LHC HLT are presented, along with
prospects for further improvements of the algorithm and its CMS central
software integration.

**Abstract**: This article presents a novel system of flow equations that models the
pressure deficit of a reservoir considered as a triple continuous medium formed
by the rock matrix, vugular medium and fracture. In non-conventional
reservoirs, the velocity of the fluid particles is altered due to physical and
chemical phenomena caused by the interaction of the fluid with the medium, this
behavior is defined as anomalous. A more exact model can be obtained with the
inclusion of the memory formalism concept that can be expressed through the use
of fractional derivatives. Using Laplace transform of the Caputo fractional
derivative and Bessel functions, a semi-analytical solution is reached in the
Laplace space.

**Abstract**: The Dark Abelian Sector Model (DASM) is an extension of the Standard Model of
particle physics with an additional spontaneously broken $U_\text{d}(1)$ gauge
symmetry connected to a dark sector, i.e. the SM particles do not carry the
corresponding charge. In addition to the gauge boson resulting from the extra
$U_\text{d}(1)$ gauge symmetry, the particle content is extended by a further
Higgs boson, one Dirac fermion as well as right-handed neutrinos. Employing the
$U_Y(1)$ field-strength tensor as well as the SM Higgs mass operator (the only
two singlet operators of the SM with dimension less than four) and the
right-handed neutrino fields, we open three portals to the dark sector.
  After an introduction of the model, we discuss a renormalization scheme for
the complete model with a special focus on the renormalization of the mixing
angles. Finally, as an example of application, we present the prediction for
the W-boson mass derived from muon decay in the DASM.

**Abstract**: Radhakrishnan et.al [Phys. Rev. Lett. 124, 110401 (2020)] proposed a
generalization of quantum discord to multipartite systems, which is consistency
with the conventional definition of discord in bipartite systems and derived
explicit formulae for any states. These results are significant in capturing
quantum correlations for multi-qubit systems. We propose a generalization of
geometric measure of multipartite quantum discord in the same manner. We find
generic forms of the generalization of geometric measure of quantum discord in
a general N-partite quantum state. Further, we obtain computable exact formulas
for the generalization of geometric measure of quantum discord in an N-qubit
quantum state, which include the results obtained in [arXiv:2104.12344].

**PDF Url**: [2407.18201v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18201v1)

**Abstract**: This paper looks at the intersection of algorithmic information theory and
physics, namely quantum mechanics, thermodynamics, and black holes. We discuss
theorems which characterize the barrier between the quantum world and the
classical realm. The notion of a "semi-classical subspace" is introduced. The
No Synchronization Law is detailed, which says separate and isolated physical
systems evolving over time cannot have thermodynamic algorithmic entropies that
are in synch. We look at future work involving the Kolmogorov complexity of
black holes.


### Violation of $γ$ in Brans-Dicke gravity
**Authors**: Hoang Ky Nguyen, Bertrand Chauvineau

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-25

**PDF Url**: [2406.17771v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.17771v2)

**Abstract**: The Brans Class I solution in Brans-Dicke gravity is a staple in the study of
gravitational theories beyond General Relativity. Discovered in 1961, it
describes the exterior vacuum of a spherical Brans-Dicke star and is
characterized by two adjustable parameters. Surprisingly, the relationship
between these parameters and the properties of the star has not been rigorously
established. In this Proceeding, we bridge this gap by deriving $\textit{the}$
complete exterior solution of Brans Class I, expressed in terms of the total
energy and total pressure of the spherisymmetric gravity source. The solution
allows for the $\textit{exact}$ derivation of $\textit{all}$ post-Newtonian
parameters in Brans-Dicke gravity for far field regions of a spherical source.
Particularly for the $\gamma$ parameter, instead of the conventional result
$\gamma_{\,\text{PPN}}=\frac{\omega+1}{\omega+2}$, we obtain the analytical
expression
$\gamma_{\,\text{exact}}=\frac{\omega+1+(\omega+2)\,\Theta}{\omega+2+(\omega+1)\,\Theta}$
where $\Theta$ is the ratio of the total pressure
$P_{\parallel}^{*}+2P_{\perp}^{*}$ and total energy $E^{*}$ contained within
the mass source. Our $\textit{non-perturbative}$ $\gamma$ formula is valid for
all field strengths and types of matter comprising the mass source.
Consequently, observational constraints on $\gamma$ thus set $\textit{joint}$
bounds on $\omega$ and $\varTheta$, with the latter representing a global
characteristic of the mass source. More broadly, our formula highlights the
importance of pressure (when $\varTheta\neq0$) in spherical Brans-Dicke stars,
and potentially in stars within other modified theories of gravitation.

**PDF Url**: [2407.18176v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18176v1)

**Abstract**: We stratify families of projective and very affine hypersurfaces according to
their topological Euler characteristic. Our new algorithms compute all strata
using algebro-geometric techniques. For very affine hypersurfaces, we
investigate and exploit the relation to critical point computations. Euler
stratifications are relevant in particle physics and algebraic statistics. They
fully describe the dependence of the number of master integrals, respectively
the maximum likelihood degree, on kinematic or model parameters.

**Abstract**: Non-reciprocal interactions are ubiquitous in nature, and in Physics this
realization has started to push boundaries by making non-hermiticity a
fundamental rather than exceptional property. Despite the prevalence of
evanescent coupling in physics, little attention has been paid to wavefunction
profiles, with reciprocity often assumed for practical reasons. Our work
challenges this assumption by demonstrating the origin of non-reciprocity in a
photonic platform. We experimentally validate non-reciprocal dynamics on
directional couplers fabricated via femtosecond laser writing, and corroborate
our findings through continuous simulations. Extending these insights, we
observe the topological Non-Hermitian Skin Effect in a Rice-Mele lattice model.
Our findings open new avenues of research using simple and scalable
configurations, and potentially guiding future developments in Physics and
beyond.

**Abstract**: The advent of memristors and resistive switching has transformed solid state
physics, enabling advanced applications such as neuromorphic computing.
Inspired by these developments, we introduce the concept of Mem-emitters,
devices that manipulate light emission properties of semiconductors to achieve
memory functionalities. Mem-emitters, influenced by past exposure to stimuli,
offer a new approach to optoelectronic computing with potential for enhanced
speed, efficiency, and integration. This study explores the unique properties
of transition metal dichalcogenides-based heterostructures as a promising
platform for Mem-emitter functionalities due to their atomic-scale thickness,
tunable electronic properties, and strong light-matter interaction. By
distinguishing between population-driven and transition rate-driven
Mem-emitters, we highlight their potential for various applications, including
optoelectronic switches, variable light sources, and advanced communication
systems. Understanding these mechanisms paves the way for innovative
technologies in memory and computation, offering insights into the intrinsic
dynamics of complex systems.


### New black ring with all independent conserved charges in five-dimensional minimal supergravity
**Authors**: Ryotaku Suzuki, Shinya Tomizawa

**Published Date**: 2024-07-25

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-25

**PDF Url**: [2407.18142v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18142v1)

**Abstract**: We present a new exact solution for a general non-BPS black ring in the
bosonic sector of five-dimensional minimal supergravity. This obtained solution
carries four independent conserved charges: the mass, two angular momenta, an
electric charge, and an additional dipole charge related to other charges. By
employing the Ehlers-Harrison transformation, we derive this solution by
transforming a five-dimensional vacuum solution into a charged solution in the
theory. Previously, our work produced a vacuum doubly rotating black ring
solution possessing a Dirac-Misner string singularity by using the Ehlers
transformation. In this study, we use the singular black ring as the seed for
the Harrison transformation. The resultant solution exhibits regularity, free
from curvature singularities, conical singularities, orbifold singularities,
Dirac-Misner string singularities, and closed timelike curves both on and
outside the horizon. We show that within a specific parameter range, the black
ring presents two branches for the same mass, two angular momenta and electric
charge but these are distinguished by a dipole charge, which exhibits
discontinuous non-uniqueness. Furthermore, this newly obtained black ring
seamlessly connects to various physically significant solutions, such as the
Pomeransky-Sen'kov black ring, the extremal black ring, the supersymmetric
black ring, and the charged singly-spinning black ring.

**Abstract**: Human head detection, keypoint estimation, and 3D head model fitting are
important tasks with many applications. However, traditional real-world
datasets often suffer from bias, privacy, and ethical concerns, and they have
been recorded in laboratory environments, which makes it difficult for trained
models to generalize. Here, we introduce VGGHeads -- a large scale synthetic
dataset generated with diffusion models for human head detection and 3D mesh
estimation. Our dataset comprises over 1 million high-resolution images, each
annotated with detailed 3D head meshes, facial landmarks, and bounding boxes.
Using this dataset we introduce a new model architecture capable of
simultaneous heads detection and head meshes reconstruction from a single image
in a single step. Through extensive experimental evaluations, we demonstrate
that models trained on our synthetic data achieve strong performance on real
images. Furthermore, the versatility of our dataset makes it applicable across
a broad spectrum of tasks, offering a general and comprehensive representation
of human heads. Additionally, we provide detailed information about the
synthetic data generation pipeline, enabling it to be re-used for other tasks
and domains.

**Abstract**: In the last few years, deep neural networks have been extensively applied in
the medical domain for different tasks, ranging from image classification and
segmentation to landmark detection. However, the application of these
technologies in the medical domain is often hindered by data scarcity, both in
terms of available annotations and images. This study introduces a new
self-supervised pre-training protocol based on diffusion models for landmark
detection in x-ray images. Our results show that the proposed self-supervised
framework can provide accurate landmark detection with a minimal number of
available annotated training images (up to 50), outperforming ImageNet
supervised pre-training and state-of-the-art self-supervised pre-trainings for
three popular x-ray benchmark datasets. To our knowledge, this is the first
exploration of diffusion models for self-supervised learning in landmark
detection, which may offer a valuable pre-training approach in few-shot
regimes, for mitigating data scarcity.

**Abstract**: Diffusion policies are conditional diffusion models that learn robot action
distributions conditioned on the robot and environment state. They have
recently shown to outperform both deterministic and alternative action
distribution learning formulations. 3D robot policies use 3D scene feature
representations aggregated from a single or multiple camera views using sensed
depth. They have shown to generalize better than their 2D counterparts across
camera viewpoints. We unify these two lines of work and present 3D Diffuser
Actor, a neural policy equipped with a novel 3D denoising transformer that
fuses information from the 3D visual scene, a language instruction and
proprioception to predict the noise in noised 3D robot pose trajectories. 3D
Diffuser Actor sets a new state-of-the-art on RLBench with an absolute
performance gain of 18.1% over the current SOTA on a multi-view setup and an
absolute gain of 13.1% on a single-view setup. On the CALVIN benchmark, it
improves over the current SOTA by a 9% relative increase. It also learns to
control a robot manipulator in the real world from a handful of demonstrations.
Through thorough comparisons with the current SOTA policies and ablations of
our model, we show 3D Diffuser Actor's design choices dramatically outperform
2D representations, regression and classification objectives, absolute
attentions, and holistic non-tokenized 3D scene embeddings.


### AttentionHand: Text-driven Controllable Hand Image Generation for 3D Hand Reconstruction in the Wild
**Authors**: Junho Park, Kyeongbo Kong, Suk-Ju Kang

**PDF Url**: [2407.18034v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.18034v1)

**Abstract**: Recently, there has been a significant amount of research conducted on 3D
hand reconstruction to use various forms of human-computer interaction.
However, 3D hand reconstruction in the wild is challenging due to extreme lack
of in-the-wild 3D hand datasets. Especially, when hands are in complex pose
such as interacting hands, the problems like appearance similarity, self-handed
occclusion and depth ambiguity make it more difficult. To overcome these
issues, we propose AttentionHand, a novel method for text-driven controllable
hand image generation. Since AttentionHand can generate various and numerous
in-the-wild hand images well-aligned with 3D hand label, we can acquire a new
3D hand dataset, and can relieve the domain gap between indoor and outdoor
scenes. Our method needs easy-to-use four modalities (i.e, an RGB image, a hand
mesh image from 3D label, a bounding box, and a text prompt). These modalities
are embedded into the latent space by the encoding phase. Then, through the
text attention stage, hand-related tokens from the given text prompt are
attended to highlight hand-related regions of the latent embedding. After the
highlighted embedding is fed to the visual attention stage, hand-related
regions in the embedding are attended by conditioning global and local hand
mesh images with the diffusion-based pipeline. In the decoding phase, the final
feature is decoded to new hand images, which are well-aligned with the given
hand mesh image and text prompt. As a result, AttentionHand achieved
state-of-the-art among text-to-hand image generation models, and the
performance of 3D hand mesh reconstruction was improved by additionally
training with hand images generated by AttentionHand.


### Self-Supervision Improves Diffusion Models for Tabular Data Imputation

**Abstract**: The ubiquity of missing data has sparked considerable attention and focus on
tabular data imputation methods. Diffusion models, recognized as the
cutting-edge technique for data generation, demonstrate significant potential
in tabular data imputation tasks. However, in pursuit of diversity, vanilla
diffusion models often exhibit sensitivity to initialized noises, which hinders
the models from generating stable and accurate imputation results.
Additionally, the sparsity inherent in tabular data poses challenges for
diffusion models in accurately modeling the data manifold, impacting the
robustness of these models for data imputation. To tackle these challenges,
this paper introduces an advanced diffusion model named Self-supervised
imputation Diffusion Model (SimpDM for brevity), specifically tailored for
tabular data imputation tasks. To mitigate sensitivity to noise, we introduce a
self-supervised alignment mechanism that aims to regularize the model, ensuring
consistent and stable imputation predictions. Furthermore, we introduce a
carefully devised state-dependent data augmentation strategy within SimpDM,
enhancing the robustness of the diffusion model when dealing with limited data.
Extensive experiments demonstrate that SimpDM matches or outperforms
state-of-the-art imputation methods across various scenarios.
