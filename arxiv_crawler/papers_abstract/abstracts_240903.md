**Abstract**: We present a lattice QCD calculation of the nucleon electric polarizabilities
at the physical pion mass. Our findings reveal the substantial contributions of
the $N\pi$ states to these polarizabilities. Without considering these
contributions, the lattice results fall significantly below the experimental
values, consistent with previous lattice studies. This observation has
motivated us to compute both the parity-negative $N\pi$ scattering up to a
nucleon momentum of $\sim0.5$ GeV in the center-of-mass frame and corresponding
$N\gamma^*\to N\pi$ matrix elements using lattice QCD. Our results confirm that
incorporating dynamic $N\pi$ contributions is crucial for a reliable
determination of the polarizabilities from lattice QCD. This methodology lays
the groundwork for future lattice QCD investigations into various other
polarizabilities.


### Analysis on the von Neumann entropy under the measurement-based feedback control

**Abstract**: The measurement-based feedback (MBF) control offers several powerful means
for preparing the desired target quantum state. Therefore, it is important to
investigate fundamental properties of MBF. In particular, how the entropy of
the controlled system under the MBF behaves is of great interest. In this
study, we examine this problem by deriving a sufficient condition that the time
derivative of the von Neumann entropy is nonnegative under the MBF control.
This result is rigorously characterized by the variance of the system
observable and the quantumness of a given decoherence. We show the validity of
the result and physical interpretation in the example of qubit stabilizing.

**Abstract**: The decays governed by the flavor-changing-neutral-current transitions
(FCNC), such as $b\to s\ell^{+}\ell^{-}$, provide an important tool to test the
physics in and beyond the Standard Model (SM). This work focuses on
investigating the FCNC process $B_{c}\to D_{s}^{*} \left(\to
D_{s}\pi\right)\ell^{+}\ell^{-}(\ell=e,\mu,\tau)$. Being an exclusive process,
the initial and final state meson matrix elements involve the form factors,
which are non-perturbative quantities and need to be calculated using specific
models. By using the form factors calculated in the covariant light-front quark
model, we analyze the branching fractions and angular observables such as the
forward-backward asymmetry $A_{FB}$, polarization fractions (Longitudinal and
transverse) $F_{L(T)}$, CP asymmetry coefficients $A_{i}$ and CP-averaged
angular coefficients $S_{i}$, both in the SM and some new physics (NP)
scenarios. Some of these physical observables are a potential source of finding
the physics beyond the SM and help us distinguish various NP scenarios.

**Abstract**: Topological Data Analysis methods can be useful for classification and
clustering tasks in many different fields as they can provide two dimensional
persistence diagrams that summarize important information about the shape of
potentially complex and high dimensional data sets. The space of persistence
diagrams can be endowed with various metrics such as the Wasserstein distance
which admit a statistical structure and allow to use these summaries for
machine learning algorithms. However, computing the distance between two
persistence diagrams involves finding an optimal way to match the points of the
two diagrams and may not always be an easy task for classical computers. In
this work we explore the potential of quantum computers to estimate the
distance between persistence diagrams, in particular we propose variational
quantum algorithms for the Wasserstein distance as well as the $d^{c}_{p}$
distance. Our implementation is a weighted version of the Quantum Approximate
Optimization Algorithm that relies on control clauses to encode the constraints
of the optimization problem.

**PDF Url**: [2403.01933v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.01933v2)

**Abstract**: Non-relativistic conformal field theory describes many-body physics at
unitarity. The correlation functions of the system are fixed by the requirement
of conformal invariance. In this article, we discuss the correlation functions
of scalar operators in non-relativistic conformal field theories in momentum
space. We discuss the solution of conformal Ward identities and express 2,3,
and 4-point functions as a function of energy and momentum. We also express the
3- and 4-point functions in the momentum space as the one-loop and three-loop
Feynman diagram computations, respectively. Lastly, we generalize the
discussion to the momentum space correlation functions in the presence of a
boundary.

**PDF Url**: [2408.17418v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17418v1)

**Abstract**: Quantum sensors based on Nitrogen Vacancy (NV) centers in diamond are highly
capable of sensing multiple physical quantities. In this study, we use
amplitude-modulated lock-in detection of optically detected magnetic resonance
of NV nanodiamonds (NVND) to investigate the link between temperature (T) and
the zero-field splitting parameter (D) and also the relationship between
magnetic field values and the difference of resonance frequencies. We also
present NVNDs' capacity to simultaneously sense both thermal and magnetic
fields in real time. This dual-sensing approach is beneficial for studying
magnetic materials whose magnetization depends on temperature and the applied
magnetic field, such as certain ferromagnetic and ferrimagnetic materials.
Integrating real-time thermal and magnetic field measurements provides unique
opportunities for failure analysis in the integrated circuit (IC) industry and
for studying thermodynamic processes in cell physiology. The ability to
concurrently monitor temperature and magnetic field variations offers a
powerful toolset for advancing precision diagnostics and monitoring in these
fields.

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-30

**PDF Url**: [2408.17411v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17411v1)

**Abstract**: The present article is devoted to the study of the dynamics of narrowband
wave fields within the non-integrable Schamel equation, which plays an
important role in plasma physics, wave dynamics in metamaterials, and
electrical circuits. A Monte Carlo approach is used to obtain a large number of
random independent realizations of the wave fields, allowing for an
investigation of the evolution of the following statistical characteristics:
spectra, moments, and distribution functions. The simulations are conducted for
different values of the Ursell number (the ratio of nonlinearity to dispersion)
to study the impact of nonlinearity and dispersion on the processes under
consideration.

**PDF Url**: [2408.17409v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17409v1)

**Abstract**: The development of analysis methods to distinguish potential beyond the
Standard Model phenomena in a model-agnostic way can significantly enhance the
discovery reach in collider experiments. However, the typical machine learning
(ML) algorithms employed for this task require fixed length and ordered inputs
that break the natural permutation invariance in collision events. To address
this, a semi-supervised anomaly detection tool is presented that takes a
variable number of particle-level inputs and leverages a signal model to encode
this information into a permutation invariant, event-level representation via
supervised training with a Particle Flow Network (PFN). Data events are then
encoded into this representation and given as input to an autoencoder for
unsupervised ANomaly deTEction on particLe flOw latent sPacE (ANTELOPE),
classifying anomalous events based on a low-level and permutation invariant
input modeling. Performance of the ANTELOPE architecture is evaluated on
simulated samples of hadronic processes in a high energy collider experiment,
showing good capability to distinguish disparate models of new physics.

**Abstract**: The transfer of population between two intersecting quantum states is the
most fundamental dynamical event that governs a broad variety of processes in
physics, chemistry, biology and material science. Whereas any two-state
description implies that population leaving one state instantaneously appears
in the other state, we show that coupling to additional states, present in all
real-world systems, can cause a measurable delay in population transfer. Using
attosecond spectroscopy supported by advanced quantum-chemical calculations, we
measure a delay of 1.46$\pm$0.41 fs at a charge-transfer state crossing in
CF$_3$I$^+$, where an electron hole moves from the fluorine atoms to iodine.
Our measurements also fully resolve the other fundamental quantum-dynamical
processes involved in the charge-transfer reaction: a vibrational rearrangement
time of 9.38$\pm$0.21 fs (during which the vibrational wave packet travels to
the state crossing) and a population-transfer time of 2.3-2.4 fs. Our
experimental results and theoretical simulations show that delays in population
transfer readily appear in otherwise-adiabatic reactions and are typically on
the order of 1 fs for intersecting molecular valence states. These results have
implications for many research areas, such as atomic and molecular physics,
charge transfer or light harvesting.

**Abstract**: The broad physics reach of the LUX-ZEPLIN (LZ) experiment covers rare
phenomena beyond the direct detection of dark matter. We report precise
measurements of the extremely rare decay of $^{124}$Xe through the process of
two-neutrino double electron capture (2$\nu$2EC), utilizing a
$1.39\,\mathrm{kg} \times \mathrm{yr}$ isotopic exposure from the first LZ
science run. A half-life of $T_{1/2}^{2\nu2\mathrm{EC}} = (1.09 \pm
0.14_{\text{stat}} \pm 0.05_{\text{sys}}) \times 10^{22}\,\mathrm{yr}$ is
observed with a statistical significance of $8.3\,\sigma$, in agreement with
literature. First empirical measurements of the KK capture fraction relative to
other K-shell modes were conducted, and demonstrate consistency with respect to
recent signal models at the $1.4\,\sigma$ level.

**Abstract**: We present Frankenstein, a diffusion-based framework that can generate
semantic-compositional 3D scenes in a single pass. Unlike existing methods that
output a single, unified 3D shape, Frankenstein simultaneously generates
multiple separated shapes, each corresponding to a semantically meaningful
part. The 3D scene information is encoded in one single tri-plane tensor, from
which multiple Singed Distance Function (SDF) fields can be decoded to
represent the compositional shapes. During training, an auto-encoder compresses
tri-planes into a latent space, and then the denoising diffusion process is
employed to approximate the distribution of the compositional scenes.
Frankenstein demonstrates promising results in generating room interiors as
well as human avatars with automatically separated parts. The generated scenes
facilitate many downstream applications, such as part-wise re-texturing, object
rearrangement in the room or avatar cloth re-targeting. Our project page is

### Image-Perfect Imperfections: Safety, Bias, and Authenticity in the Shadow of Text-To-Image Model Evolution
**Authors**: Yixin Wu, Yun Shen, Michael Backes, Yang Zhang

**Published Date**: 2024-08-30

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-30

**PDF Url**: [2408.17285v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17285v1)

**Abstract**: Text-to-image models, such as Stable Diffusion (SD), undergo iterative
updates to improve image quality and address concerns such as safety.
Improvements in image quality are straightforward to assess. However, how model
updates resolve existing concerns and whether they raise new questions remain
unexplored. This study takes an initial step in investigating the evolution of
text-to-image models from the perspectives of safety, bias, and authenticity.
Our findings, centered on Stable Diffusion, indicate that model updates paint a
mixed picture. While updates progressively reduce the generation of unsafe
images, the bias issue, particularly in gender, intensifies. We also find that
negative stereotypes either persist within the same Non-White race group or
shift towards other Non-White race groups through SD updates, yet with minimal
association of these traits with the White race group. Additionally, our
evaluation reveals a new concern stemming from SD updates: State-of-the-art
fake image detectors, initially trained for earlier SD versions, struggle to
identify fake images generated by updated versions. We show that fine-tuning
these detectors on fake images generated by updated versions achieves at least
96.6\% accuracy across various SD versions, addressing this issue. Our insights
highlight the importance of continued efforts to mitigate biases and
vulnerabilities in evolving text-to-image models.


### Object-Centric Diffusion for Efficient Video Editing

**Abstract**: Diffusion-based video editing have reached impressive quality and can
transform either the global style, local structure, and attributes of given
video inputs, following textual edit prompts. However, such solutions typically
incur heavy memory and computational costs to generate temporally-coherent
frames, either in the form of diffusion inversion and/or cross-frame attention.
In this paper, we conduct an analysis of such inefficiencies, and suggest
simple yet effective modifications that allow significant speed-ups whilst
maintaining quality. Moreover, we introduce Object-Centric Diffusion, to fix
generation artifacts and further reduce latency by allocating more computations
towards foreground edited regions, arguably more important for perceptual
quality. We achieve this by two novel proposals: i) Object-Centric Sampling,
decoupling the diffusion steps spent on salient or background regions and
spending most on the former, and ii) Object-Centric Token Merging, which
reduces cost of cross-frame attention by fusing redundant tokens in unimportant
background regions. Both techniques are readily applicable to a given video
editing model without retraining, and can drastically reduce its memory and
computational cost. We evaluate our proposals on inversion-based and
control-signal-based editing pipelines, and show a latency reduction up to 10x
for a comparable synthesis quality. Project page:

**Abstract**: Electrical load forecasting plays a crucial role in decision-making for power
systems, including unit commitment and economic dispatch. The integration of
renewable energy sources and the occurrence of external events, such as the
COVID-19 pandemic, have rapidly increased uncertainties in load forecasting.
The uncertainties in load forecasting can be divided into two types: epistemic
uncertainty and aleatoric uncertainty. Separating these types of uncertainties
can help decision-makers better understand where and to what extent the
uncertainty is, thereby enhancing their confidence in the following
decision-making. This paper proposes a diffusion-based Seq2Seq structure to
estimate epistemic uncertainty and employs the robust additive Cauchy
distribution to estimate aleatoric uncertainty. Our method not only ensures the
accuracy of load forecasting but also demonstrates the ability to separate the
two types of uncertainties and be applicable to different levels of loads. The
relevant code can be found at

**Abstract**: The Diffusion Transformers Models (DiTs) have transitioned the network
architecture from traditional UNets to transformers, demonstrating exceptional
capabilities in image generation. Although DiTs have been widely applied to
high-definition video generation tasks, their large parameter size hinders
inference on edge devices. Vector quantization (VQ) can decompose model weight
into a codebook and assignments, allowing extreme weight quantization and
significantly reducing memory usage. In this paper, we propose VQ4DiT, a fast
post-training vector quantization method for DiTs. We found that traditional VQ
methods calibrate only the codebook without calibrating the assignments. This
leads to weight sub-vectors being incorrectly assigned to the same assignment,
providing inconsistent gradients to the codebook and resulting in a suboptimal
result. To address this challenge, VQ4DiT calculates the candidate assignment
set for each weight sub-vector based on Euclidean distance and reconstructs the
sub-vector based on the weighted average. Then, using the zero-data and
block-wise calibration method, the optimal assignment from the set is
efficiently selected while calibrating the codebook. VQ4DiT quantizes a DiT
XL/2 model on a single NVIDIA A100 GPU within 20 minutes to 5 hours depending
on the different quantization settings. Experiments show that VQ4DiT
establishes a new state-of-the-art in model size and performance trade-offs,
quantizing weights to 2-bit precision while retaining acceptable image
generation quality.

### A Framework for Digital Asset Risks with Insurance Applications
**Authors**: Zhengming Li, Jianxi Su, Maochao Xu, Jimmy Yuen

**Published Date**: 2024-08-30

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-30

**PDF Url**: [2408.17227v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.17227v1)

**Abstract**: The remarkable growth of digital assets, starting from the inception of
Bitcoin in 2009 into a 1 trillion market in 2024, underscores the momentum
behind disruptive technologies and the global appetite for digital assets. This
paper develops a framework to enhance actuaries' understanding of the cyber
risks associated with the developing digital asset ecosystem, as well as their
measurement methods in the context of digital asset insurance. By integrating
actuarial perspectives, we aim to enhance understanding and modeling of cyber
risks at both the micro and systemic levels. The qualitative examination sheds
light on blockchain technology and its associated risks, while our quantitative
framework offers a rigorous approach to modeling cyber risks in digital asset
insurance portfolios. This multifaceted approach serves three primary
objectives: i) offer a clear and accessible education on the evolving digital
asset ecosystem and the diverse spectrum of cyber risks it entails; ii) develop
a scientifically rigorous framework for quantifying cyber risks in the digital
asset ecosystem; iii) provide practical applications, including pricing
strategies and tail risk management. Particularly, we develop
frequency-severity models based on real loss data for pricing cyber risks in
digit assets and utilize Monte Carlo simulation to estimate the tail risks,
offering practical insights for risk management strategies. As digital assets
continue to reshape finance, our work serves as a foundational step towards
safeguarding the integrity and stability of this rapidly evolving landscape.
