**Abstract**: Adjoint methods have been the pillar of gradient-based optimization for
decades. They enable the accurate computation of a gradient (sensitivity) of a
quantity of interest with respect to all system's parameters in one
calculation. When the gradient is embedded in an optimization routine, the
quantity of interest can be optimized for the system to have the desired
behaviour. Adjoint methods require the system's governing equations and their
Jacobian. We propose a computational strategy to infer the adjoint
sensitivities from data when the governing equations might be unknown (or
partly unknown), and noise might be present. The key component of this strategy
is an echo state network, which learns the dynamics of nonlinear regimes with
varying parameters, and evolves dynamically via a hidden state. Although the
framework is general, we focus on thermoacoustics governed by nonlinear and
time-delayed systems. First, we show that a parameter-aware Echo State Network
(ESN) infers the parameterized dynamics. Second, we derive the adjoint of the
ESN to compute the sensitivity to parameters and initial conditions. Third, we
propose the Thermoacoustic Echo State Network (T-ESN), which embeds the
physical knowledge in the network architecture. Fourth, we apply the framework
to a variety of nonlinear thermoacoustic regimes of a prototypical system. We
show that the T-ESN accurately infers the correct adjoint sensitivities of the
time-averaged acoustic energy with respect to the flame parameters. The results
are robust to noisy data, from periodic, through quasiperiodic, to chaotic
regimes. A single network predicts the nonlinear bifurcations on unseen
scenarios, and so the inferred adjoint sensitivities are employed to suppress
an instability via steepest descent. This work opens new possibilities for
gradient-based data-driven design optimization.

**Abstract**: In perovskite oxide heterostructures, bulk functional properties coexist with
emergent physical phenomena at epitaxial interfaces. Notably, charge transfer
at the interface between two insulating oxide layers can lead to the formation
of a two-dimensional electron gas (2DEG) with possible applications in, e.g.,
high-electronmobility transistors and ferroelectric field-effect transistors.
So far, the realization of oxide 2DEGs is, however, largely limited to the
interface between the single-crystal substrate and epitaxial film, preventing
their deliberate placement inside a larger device architecture. Additionally,
the substrate-limited quality of perovskite oxide interfaces hampers
room-temperature 2DEG performance due to notoriously low electron mobility. In
this work, we demonstrate the controlled creation of an interfacial 2DEG at the
epitaxial interface between perovskite oxides BaSnO$_3$ and LaInO$_3$ with
enhanced room-temperature electron mobilities up to 119 cm$^2$/Vs - the highest
room-temperature value reported so far for a perovskite oxide 2DEG. Using a
combination of state-of-the-art deposition modes during oxide molecular beam
epitaxy, our approach opens up another degree of freedom in optimization and
$in$-$situ$ control of the interface between two epitaxial oxide layers away
from the substrate interface. We thus expect our approach to apply to the
general class of perovskite oxide 2DEG systems and to enable their improved
compatibility with novel device concepts and integration across materials
platforms.

**Abstract**: New particles beyond the Standard Model of particle physics, such as axions,
can be effectively searched through their interactions with electrons. We use
the large liquid xenon detector PandaX-4T to search for novel electronic recoil
signals induced by solar axions, neutrinos with anomalous magnetic moment,
axion-like particles, dark photons, and light fermionic dark matter. A detailed
background model is established with the latest datasets with 1.54 $\rm tonne
\cdot year$ exposure. No significant excess above the background has been
observed, and we have obtained competitive constraints for axion couplings,
neutrino magnetic moment, and fermionic dark matter interactions.

**Abstract**: The field of neural quantum states has recently experienced a tremendous
progress, making them a competitive tool of computational quantum many-body
physics. However, their largest achievements to date mostly concern interacting
spin systems, while their utility for quantum chemistry remains yet to be
demonstrated. Two main complications are the peaked structure of the molecular
wave functions, which impedes sampling, and large number of terms in second
quantised Hamiltonians, which hinders scaling to larger molecule sizes. In this
paper we address these issues jointly and argue that the peaked structure might
actually be key to drastically more efficient calculations. Specifically, we
introduce a novel algorithm for autoregressive sampling without replacement and
a procedure to calculate a computationally cheaper surrogate for the local
energy. We complement them with a custom modification of the stochastic
reconfiguration optimisation technique and a highly optimised GPU
implementation. As a result, our calculations require substantially less
resources and exhibit more than order of magnitude speedup compared to the
previous works. On a single GPU we study molecules comprising up to 118 qubits
and outperform the ``golden standard'' CCSD(T) benchmark in Hilbert spaces of
$\sim 10^{15}$ Slater determinants, which is orders of magnitude larger than
what was previously achieved. We believe that our work underscores the prospect
of NQS for challenging quantum chemistry calculations and serves as a
favourable ground for the future method development.

**PDF Url**: [2401.06064v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06064v2)

**Abstract**: Quantum states of angular momentum and spin generally are not invariant under
rotations of the reference frame. Therefore, they can be used as a resource of
relative orientation, which is encoded in the asymmetry of the state under
consideration. In this paper we introduce the analytical characterization of
the rotational information by parameterizing the group characteristic function
by polynomial functions. By doing so, we show that the set of states achievable
through transformations lacking a reference frame (rotationally covariant ones)
admits an analytical characterization and can be studied through the use of
semidefinite optimization techniques. We demonstrate the developed methods via
examples, and provide a physical scenario in which a reference-independent
operation performs a metrologically useful operation: the preparation of a
state of light improving interferometer sensitivity, which equivalently can be
realized as a postprocessing step.


### Measurement of the Drell--Yan forward-backward asymmetry and of the effective leptonic weak mixing angle in proton-proton collisions at $\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV
**Authors**: CMS Collaboration

**PDF Url**: [2408.07622v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07622v1)

**Abstract**: The forward-backward asymmetry in Drell-Yan production and the effective
leptonic electroweak mixing angle are measured in proton-proton collisions at
$\sqrt{s}$ = 13 TeV, collected by the CMS experiment and corresponding to an
integrated luminosity of 138 fb$^{-1}$. The measurement uses both dimuon and
dielectron events, and is performed as a function of the dilepton mass and
rapidity. The unfolded angular coefficient $A_4$ is also extracted, as a
function of the dilepton mass and rapidity. Using the CT18Z set of parton
distribution functions, we obtain $\sin\theta^\ell_\text{eff}$ = 0.23157 $\pm$
0.00031, where the uncertainty includes the experimental and theoretical
contributions. The measured value agrees with the standard model fit result to
global experimental data. This is the most precise $\sin\theta^\ell_\text{eff}$
measurement at a hadron collider, with a precision comparable to the results
obtained at LEP and SLD.

**Abstract**: A random access code (RAC), corresponding to a communication primitive with
various applications in quantum information theory, is an instance of a
preparation-and-measurement scenario. In this work, we consider (n,d)-RACs
constituting an "n"-length string, constructed from a "d" size set of letters,
and send an encoding of the string in a single d-level physical system and
present their quantum advantages. We first characterize optimal classical RACs,
proving that the well-known classical strategy known as
majority-encoding-identity-decoding is indeed optimal. We then construct a
quantum protocol by exploiting only two incompatible measurements, the minimal
requirement, and show the advantages beyond the classical one. We also discuss
the generality of our results and whether quantum advantages are valid for all
types of (n, d)->1 RACs.


### Chiral-Extended Photon-Emitter Dressed States in Non-Hermitian Topological Baths

**Abstract**: The interplay of quantum emitters and non-Hermitian structured baths has
received increasing attention in recent years. Here, we predict unconventional
quantum optical behaviors of quantum emitters coupled to a non-Hermitian
topological bath, which is realized in a 1D Su-Schrieffer-Heeger photonic chain
subjected to nonlocal dissipation. In addition to the Hermitian-like chiral
bound states in the middle line gap and skin-mode-like hidden bound states
inside the point gap, we identify peculiar in-gap chiral and extended
photon-emitter dressed states. This is due to the competition of
topological-edge localization and non-Hermitian skin-mode localization in
combination with the non-Bloch bulk-boundary correspondence. Furthermore, when
two emitters are coupled to the same bath, such in-gap dressed states can
mediate the nonreciprocal long-range emitter-emitter interactions, with the
interaction range limited only by the dissipation of the bath. Our work opens
the door to further study rich quantum optical phenomena and exotic many-body
physics utilizing quantum emitters coupled to non-Hermitian topological baths.

**PDF Url**: [2403.06673v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.06673v2)

**Abstract**: Ensemble inequivalence, i.e. the possibility of observing different
thermodynamic properties depending on the statistical ensemble which describes
the system, is one of the hallmarks of long-range physics, which has been
demonstrated in numerous classical systems. Here, an example of ensemble
inequivalence of a long-range quantum ferromagnet is presented. While the $T=0$
microcanonical quantum phase-diagram coincides with that of the canonical
ensemble, the phase-diagrams of the two ensembles are different at finite
temperature. This is in contrast with the common lore of statistical mechanics
of systems with short-range interactions where thermodynamic properties are
bound to coincide for macroscopic systems described by different ensembles. The
consequences of these findings in the context of atomic, molecular and optical
(AMO) setups are delineated.


## Diffusion
### Drug Discovery SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetics Diffusion Models with Deep Molecular Understanding
**Authors**: Bing Hu, Anita Layton, Helen Chen

**PDF Url**: [2408.07636v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07636v1)

**Abstract**: Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly used in every stage of drug
development. One challenge facing drug discovery AI is that drug
pharmacokinetic (PK) datasets are often collected independently from each
other, often with limited overlap, creating data overlap sparsity. Data
sparsity makes data curation difficult for researchers looking to answer
research questions in poly-pharmacy, drug combination research, and
high-throughput screening. We propose Imagand, a novel
SMILES-to-Pharmacokinetic (S2PK) diffusion model capable of generating an array
of PK target properties conditioned on SMILES inputs. We show that
Imagand-generated synthetic PK data closely resembles real data univariate and
bivariate distributions, and improves performance for downstream tasks. Imagand
is a promising solution for data overlap sparsity and allows researchers to
efficiently generate ligand PK data for drug discovery research. Code is
available at \url{https://github.com/bing1100/Imagand}.


### PeriodWave: Multi-Period Flow Matching for High-Fidelity Waveform Generation

**PDF Url**: [2408.07547v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07547v1)

**Abstract**: Recently, universal waveform generation tasks have been investigated
conditioned on various out-of-distribution scenarios. Although GAN-based
methods have shown their strength in fast waveform generation, they are
vulnerable to train-inference mismatch scenarios such as two-stage
text-to-speech. Meanwhile, diffusion-based models have shown their powerful
generative performance in other domains; however, they stay out of the
limelight due to slow inference speed in waveform generation tasks. Above all,
there is no generator architecture that can explicitly disentangle the natural
periodic features of high-resolution waveform signals. In this paper, we
propose PeriodWave, a novel universal waveform generation model. First, we
introduce a period-aware flow matching estimator that can capture the periodic
features of the waveform signal when estimating the vector fields.
Additionally, we utilize a multi-period estimator that avoids overlaps to
capture different periodic features of waveform signals. Although increasing
the number of periods can improve the performance significantly, this requires
more computational costs. To reduce this issue, we also propose a single
period-conditional universal estimator that can feed-forward parallel by
period-wise batch inference. Additionally, we utilize discrete wavelet
transform to losslessly disentangle the frequency information of waveform
signals for high-frequency modeling, and introduce FreeU to reduce the
high-frequency noise for waveform generation. The experimental results
demonstrated that our model outperforms the previous models both in
Mel-spectrogram reconstruction and text-to-speech tasks. All source code will
be available at \url{https://github.com/sh-lee-prml/PeriodWave}.


### DifuzCam: Replacing Camera Lens with a Mask and a Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Erez Yosef, Raja Giryes

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-14

**PDF Url**: [2408.07541v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07541v1)

**Abstract**: The flat lensless camera design reduces the camera size and weight
significantly. In this design, the camera lens is replaced by another optical
element that interferes with the incoming light. The image is recovered from
the raw sensor measurements using a reconstruction algorithm. Yet, the quality
of the reconstructed images is not satisfactory. To mitigate this, we propose
utilizing a pre-trained diffusion model with a control network and a learned
separable transformation for reconstruction. This allows us to build a
prototype flat camera with high-quality imaging, presenting state-of-the-art
results in both terms of quality and perceptuality. We demonstrate its ability
to leverage also textual descriptions of the captured scene to further enhance
reconstruction. Our reconstruction method which leverages the strong
capabilities of a pre-trained diffusion model can be used in other imaging
systems for improved reconstruction results.


### Unsupervised Blind Joint Dereverberation and Room Acoustics Estimation with Diffusion Models

**PDF Url**: [2408.07472v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.07472v1)

**Abstract**: This paper presents an unsupervised method for single-channel blind
dereverberation and room impulse response (RIR) estimation, called BUDDy. The
algorithm is rooted in Bayesian posterior sampling: it combines a likelihood
model enforcing fidelity to the reverberant measurement, and an anechoic speech
prior implemented by an unconditional diffusion model. We design a parametric
filter representing the RIR, with exponential decay for each frequency subband.
Room acoustics estimation and speech dereverberation are jointly carried out,
as the filter parameters are iteratively estimated and the speech utterance
refined along the reverse diffusion trajectory. In a blind scenario where the
room impulse response is unknown, BUDDy successfully performs speech
dereverberation in various acoustic scenarios, significantly outperforming
other blind unsupervised baselines. Unlike supervised methods, which often
struggle to generalize, BUDDy seamlessly adapts to different acoustic
conditions. This paper extends our previous work by offering new experimental
results and insights into the algorithm's performance and versatility. We first
investigate the robustness of informed dereverberation methods to RIR
estimation errors, to motivate the joint acoustic estimation and
dereverberation paradigm. Then, we demonstrate the adaptability of our method
to high-resolution singing voice dereverberation, study its performance in RIR
estimation, and conduct subjective evaluation experiments to validate the
perceptual quality of the results, among other contributions. Audio samples and
code can be found online.


### GRIF-DM: Generation of Rich Impression Fonts using Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: Fonts are integral to creative endeavors, design processes, and artistic
productions. The appropriate selection of a font can significantly enhance
artwork and endow advertisements with a higher level of expressivity. Despite
the availability of numerous diverse font designs online, traditional
retrieval-based methods for font selection are increasingly being supplanted by
generation-based approaches. These newer methods offer enhanced flexibility,
catering to specific user preferences and capturing unique stylistic
impressions. However, current impression font techniques based on Generative
Adversarial Networks (GANs) necessitate the utilization of multiple auxiliary
losses to provide guidance during generation. Furthermore, these methods
commonly employ weighted summation for the fusion of impression-related
keywords. This leads to generic vectors with the addition of more impression
keywords, ultimately lacking in detail generation capacity. In this paper, we
introduce a diffusion-based method, termed \ourmethod, to generate fonts that
vividly embody specific impressions, utilizing an input consisting of a single
letter and a set of descriptive impression keywords. The core innovation of
\ourmethod lies in the development of dual cross-attention modules, which
process the characteristics of the letters and impression keywords
independently but synergistically, ensuring effective integration of both types
of information. Our experimental results, conducted on the MyFonts dataset,
affirm that this method is capable of producing realistic, vibrant, and
high-fidelity fonts that are closely aligned with user specifications. This
confirms the potential of our approach to revolutionize font generation by
accommodating a broad spectrum of user-driven design requirements. Our code is
publicly available at \url{https://github.com/leitro/GRIF-DM}.
