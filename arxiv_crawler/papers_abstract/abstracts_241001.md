**Abstract**: We study novel itinerant phases that can be accessed by doping a fractional
quantum anomalous Hall (FQAH) insulator, with a focus on the experimentally
observed Jain states at lattice filling $\nu = p/(2p+1)$. Unlike in the lowest
Landau level, where charge motion is confined into cyclotron orbits, the
charged excitations in the FQAH occupy Bloch states with well-defined crystal
momenta. At a non-zero doping density, this enables the formation of itinerant
states of the doped anyons just beyond the FQAH plateau region. Specializing to
the vicinity of $\nu = 2/3$, we describe a few possible such itinerant states.
These include a topological superconductor with chiral neutral fermion edge
modes as well as a more exotic Pair Density Wave (PDW) superconductor with
non-trivial non-Abelian topological order. A Fermi liquid metal with a
doping-induced period-3 charge density wave also occurs naturally in our
analysis. This Fermi liquid (as well as the PDW) arises from pairing
instabilities of a composite Fermi liquid metal that can emerge near filling
$2/3$. Though inspired by the theory of anyon superconductivity, we explain how
our construction is qualitatively different. At a general Jain filling $\nu =
p/(2p+1)$, the same analytical framework leads to a wider variety of phases
including higher-charge superconductors and generalized composite Fermi
liquids. We predict unusual physical signatures associated with each phase and
analyze the crossover between different temperature regimes. These results
provide a proof-of-principle that exotic itinerant phases can be stabilized by
correlations intrinsic to the FQAH setup.

**Abstract**: Sampling from high-dimensional, multi-modal distributions remains a
fundamental challenge across domains such as statistical Bayesian inference and
physics-based machine learning. In this paper, we propose Annealing Flow (AF),
a continuous normalizing flow-based approach designed to sample from
high-dimensional and multi-modal distributions. The key idea is to learn a
continuous normalizing flow-based transport map, guided by annealing, to
transition samples from an easy-to-sample distribution to the target
distribution, facilitating effective exploration of modes in high-dimensional
spaces. Unlike many existing methods, AF training does not rely on samples from
the target distribution. AF ensures effective and balanced mode exploration,
achieves linear complexity in sample size and dimensions, and circumvents
inefficient mixing times. We demonstrate the superior performance of AF
compared to state-of-the-art methods through extensive experiments on various
challenging distributions and real-world datasets, particularly in
high-dimensional and multi-modal settings. We also highlight the potential of
AF for sampling the least favorable distributions.

**Abstract**: Control Lyapunov functions are a central tool in the design and analysis of
stabilizing controllers for nonlinear systems. Constructing such functions,
however, remains a significant challenge. In this paper, we investigate
physics-informed learning and formal verification of neural network control
Lyapunov functions. These neural networks solve a transformed
Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, augmented by data generated using
Pontryagin's maximum principle. Similar to how Zubov's equation characterizes
the domain of attraction for autonomous systems, this equation characterizes
the null-controllability set of a controlled system. This principled learning
of neural network control Lyapunov functions outperforms alternative
approaches, such as sum-of-squares and rational control Lyapunov functions, as
demonstrated by numerical examples. As an intermediate step, we also present
results on the formal verification of quadratic control Lyapunov functions,
which, aided by satisfiability modulo theories solvers, can perform
surprisingly well compared to more sophisticated approaches and efficiently
produce global certificates of null-controllability.


### On Mixed Quantum/Classical Theory for Rotationally Inelastic Scattering of Identical Collision Partners
**Authors**: Dulat Bostan, Bikramaditya Mandal, Dmitri Babikov

**Abstract**: Mixed quantum/classical theory (MQCT) for the treatment of rotationally
inelastic transitions during collisions of two identical molecules, described
either as indistinguishable or distinguishable partners, is reviewed. The
treatment of two molecules as indistinguishable includes symmetrization of
rotational wavefunctions, introduces exchange parity, and gives state-to-state
transition matrix elements different from those in the straightforward
treatment of molecules as distinguishable. Moreover, the treatment of collision
partners as indistinguishable is eight times faster. Numerical results,
presented for $H_2 + H_2$, CO + CO and $H_2O + H_2O$ systems, indicate good
agreement of MQCT calculations with full-quantum calculations from literature
and show that an a posteriori correction, applied after the treatment of
collision partners as distinguishable, generally produces good results that
agree well with the rigorous treatment of collision partners as
indistinguishable. This correction for cross section includes either
multiplication by 2, or summation over physically indistinguishable processes,
depending on the transition type. After this correction, the results of two
treatments agree within 5% for most but may reach 10-20% for some transitions.
At low collision energies dominated by scattering resonances these differences
can be larger, but they tend to decrease as collision energy is increased. It
is also shown that if the system is artificially forced to follow the same
collision path in the indistinguishable and distinguishable treatments, then
all differences between the results of two treatments disappear. This
interesting finding gives new insight into the collision process and indicates
that indistinguishability of identical collision partners comes into play
through the collision path itself, rather than through matrix elements of
inelastic transitions.

**Authors**: Jinyu Wan, Yue Hao, Helena Alamprese, Christian Ratcliff, Ji Qiang

**Published Date**: 2024-09-30

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-30

**PDF Url**: [2409.20522v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20522v1)

**Abstract**: Efficient accelerator modeling and particle tracking are key for the design
and configuration of modern particle accelerators. In this work, we present
JUTRACK, a nested accelerator modeling package developed in Julia programing
language and enhanced with compiler-level automatic differentiation (AD). With
the aid of AD, JUTRACK enables rapid derivative calculations in accelerator
modeling, facilitating sensitivity analyses and optimization tasks. We
demonstrate the effectiveness of AD-derived derivatives through several
practical applications, including sensitivity analysis of space-charge-induced
emittance growth, nonlinear beam dynamics analysis for a synchrotron light
source, and lattice parameter tuning of the future Electron-Ion Collider (EIC).
Through the incorporation of automatic differentiation, this package opens up
new possibilities for accelerator physicists in beam physics studies and
accelerator design optimization.


### A physics-compliant diagonal representation for wireless channels parametrized by beyond-diagonal reconfigurable intelligent surfaces
**Authors**: Philipp del Hougne

**Abstract**: The parametrization of wireless channels by so-called "beyond-diagonal
reconfigurable intelligent surfaces" (BD-RIS) is mathematically characterized
by a matrix whose off-diagonal entries are partially or fully populated.
Physically, this corresponds to tunable coupling mechanisms between the RIS
elements that originate from the RIS control circuit. Here, we derive a
physics-compliant diagonal representation for BD-RIS-parametrized channels.
Recognizing that the RIS control circuit, irrespective of its detailed
architecture, can always be represented as a multi-port network with auxiliary
ports terminated by tunable individual loads, we physics-compliantly express
the BD-RIS-parametrized channel as a multi-port chain cascade of i) radio
environment, ii) static parts of the control circuit, and iii) individually
tunable loads. Thus, the cascade of the former two systems is terminated by a
system that is mathematically always characterized by a diagonal matrix. This
physics-compliant diagonal representation implies that existing algorithms for
channel estimation and optimization for conventional ("diagonal") RIS can be
readily applied to BD-RIS scenarios. We demonstrate this in an experimentally
grounded case study. Importantly, we highlight that, operationally, an
ambiguous characterization of the cascade of radio environment and the static
parts of the control circuit is required, but not the breakdown into the
characteristics of its two constituent systems nor the lifting of the
ambiguities. Nonetheless, we demonstrate how to derive or estimate the
characteristics of the static parts of the control circuit for pedagogical
purposes. The diagonal representation of BD-RIS-parametrized channels also
enables their treatment with coupled-dipole-based models. We furthermore derive
the assumptions under which the physics-compliant BD-RIS model simplifies to
the widespread linear cascaded model.

**Authors**: Pavel Serhiayenka, Stephen Roche, Benjamin Carlson, Tae Min Hong

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-30

**PDF Url**: [2409.20506v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20506v1)

**Abstract**: We present a generic parallel implementation of the decision tree-based
machine learning (ML) method in hardware description language (HDL) on field
programmable gate arrays (FPGA). A regression problem in high energy physics at
the Large Hadron Collider is considered: the estimation of the magnitude of
missing transverse momentum using boosted decision trees (BDT). A forest of
twenty decision trees each with a maximum depth of ten using eight input
variables of 16-bit precision is executed with a latency of less than 10 ns
using O(0.1%) resources on Xilinx UltraScale+ VU9P -- approximately ten times
faster and five times smaller compared to similar designs using high level
synthesis (HLS) -- without the use of digital signal processors (DSP) while
eliminating the use of block RAM (BRAM). We also demonstrate a potential
application in the estimation of muon momentum for ATLAS RPC at HL-LHC.


### Maximal device-independent randomness in every dimension

**Abstract**: Random numbers are used in a wide range of sciences. In many applications,
generating unpredictable private random numbers is indispensable.
Device-independent quantum random number generation is a framework that makes
use of the intrinsic randomness of quantum processes to generate numbers that
are fundamentally unpredictable according to our current understanding of
physics. While device-independent quantum random number generation is an
exceptional theoretical feat, the difficulty of controlling quantum systems
makes it challenging to carry out in practice. It is therefore desirable to
harness the full power of the quantum degrees of freedom (the dimension) that
one can control. It is known that no more than $2 \log(d)$ bits of private
device-independent randomness can be extracted from a quantum system of local
dimension $d$. In this paper we demonstrate that this bound can be achieved for
all dimensions $d$ by providing a family of explicit protocols. In order to
obtain our result, we develop new certification techniques that can be of wider
interest in device-independent applications for scenarios in which complete
certification ('self-testing') is impossible or impractical.


### Sparse space-time resolvent analysis for statistically-stationary and time-varying flows

**Abstract**: Resolvent analysis provides a framework to predict coherent spatio-temporal
structures of largest linear energy amplification, through a singular value
decomposition (SVD) of the resolvent operator, obtained by linearizing the
Navier-Stokes equations about a known turbulent mean velocity profile.
Resolvent analysis utilizes a Fourier decomposition in time, which limits its
application to statistically-stationary or time-periodic flows. This work
develops a variant of resolvent analysis applicable to time-evolving flows, and
proposes a variant that identifies spatio-temporally sparse structures,
applicable to either stationary or time-varying systems. Spatio-temporal
resolvent analysis is formulated through the incorporation of the temporal
dimension via a discrete time-differentiation operator. Sparsity (localisation)
is achieved through the addition of an l1-norm penalisation term to the
optimisation associated with the SVD. This modified problem can be formulated
as a nonlinear eigenproblem, and solved via an inverse power method. We first
showcase the implementation of the sparse analysis on statistically-stationary
turbulent channel flow, and demonstrate that the sparse variant can identify
aspects of the physics not directly evident from standard resolvent analysis.
This is followed by applying the sparse space-time formulation on systems that
are time-varying: a time-periodic turbulent Stokes boundary layer, and then a
turbulent channel flow with a sudden imposition of a lateral pressure gradient,
with the original streamwise pressure gradient unchanged. We present results
demonstrating how the sparsity-promoting variant can either change the
quantitative structure of the leading space-time modes to increase their
sparsity, or identify entirely different linear amplification mechanisms
compared to non-sparse resolvent analysis.


### Uncovering Hidden Patterns: Approximate Resurgent Resummation from Truncated Series
**Authors**: Alessio Maiezza, Juan Carlos Vasquez

**Published Date**: 2024-09-30

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-30

**PDF Url**: [2409.20458v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20458v1)

**Abstract**: We analyze truncated series generated as divergent formal solutions of
non-linear ordinary differential equations. Motivating the study is a specific
non-linear, first-order differential equation, which is the basis of the
resurgent formulation of renormalized perturbation theory in quantum field
theory. We use the Borel-Pad\'e approximant and classical analysis to determine
the analytic structure of the solution using the first few terms of its
asymptotic series. Afterward, we build an approximant, consistent with the
resurgent properties of the equation. The procedure gives an approximate
expression for the Borel-Ecalle resummation of the solution useful for
practical applications. Connections with other physical applications are also
discussed.


## Diffusion
### COLLAGE: Collaborative Human-Agent Interaction Generation using Hierarchical Latent Diffusion and Language Models
**Authors**: Divyanshu Daiya, Damon Conover, Aniket Bera

**Published Date**: 2024-09-30

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-30

**PDF Url**: [2409.20502v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.20502v1)

**Abstract**: We propose a novel framework COLLAGE for generating collaborative
agent-object-agent interactions by leveraging large language models (LLMs) and
hierarchical motion-specific vector-quantized variational autoencoders
(VQ-VAEs). Our model addresses the lack of rich datasets in this domain by
incorporating the knowledge and reasoning abilities of LLMs to guide a
generative diffusion model. The hierarchical VQ-VAE architecture captures
different motion-specific characteristics at multiple levels of abstraction,
avoiding redundant concepts and enabling efficient multi-resolution
representation. We introduce a diffusion model that operates in the latent
space and incorporates LLM-generated motion planning cues to guide the
denoising process, resulting in prompt-specific motion generation with greater
control and diversity. Experimental results on the CORE-4D, and InterHuman
datasets demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach in generating realistic
and diverse collaborative human-object-human interactions, outperforming
state-of-the-art methods. Our work opens up new possibilities for modeling
complex interactions in various domains, such as robotics, graphics and
computer vision.

**Abstract**: Neural Architecture Search (NAS) automates neural network design, reducing
dependence on human expertise. While NAS methods are computationally intensive
and dataset-specific, auxiliary predictors reduce the models needing training,
decreasing search time. This strategy is used to generate architectures
satisfying multiple computational constraints. Recently, Transferable NAS has
emerged, generalizing the search process from dataset-dependent to
task-dependent. In this field, DiffusionNAG is a state-of-the-art method. This
diffusion-based approach streamlines computation, generating architectures
optimized for accuracy on unseen datasets without further adaptation. However,
by focusing solely on accuracy, DiffusionNAG overlooks other crucial objectives
like model complexity, computational efficiency, and inference latency --
factors essential for deploying models in resource-constrained environments.
This paper introduces the Pareto-Optimal Many-Objective Neural Architecture
Generator (POMONAG), extending DiffusionNAG via a many-objective diffusion
process. POMONAG simultaneously considers accuracy, number of parameters,
multiply-accumulate operations (MACs), and inference latency. It integrates
Performance Predictor models to estimate these metrics and guide diffusion
gradients. POMONAG's optimization is enhanced by expanding its training
Meta-Dataset, applying Pareto Front Filtering, and refining embeddings for
conditional generation. These enhancements enable POMONAG to generate
Pareto-optimal architectures that outperform the previous state-of-the-art in
performance and efficiency. Results were validated on two search spaces --
NASBench201 and MobileNetV3 -- and evaluated across 15 image classification
datasets.

**Abstract**: Artificial intelligence models have shown great potential in structure-based
drug design, generating ligands with high binding affinities. However, existing
models have often overlooked a crucial physical constraint: atoms must maintain
a minimum pairwise distance to avoid separation violation, a phenomenon
governed by the balance of attractive and repulsive forces. To mitigate such
separation violations, we propose NucleusDiff. It models the interactions
between atomic nuclei and their surrounding electron clouds by enforcing the
distance constraint between the nuclei and manifolds. We quantitatively
evaluate NucleusDiff using the CrossDocked2020 dataset and a COVID-19
therapeutic target, demonstrating that NucleusDiff reduces violation rate by up
to 100.00% and enhances binding affinity by up to 22.16%, surpassing
state-of-the-art models for structure-based drug design. We also provide
qualitative analysis through manifold sampling, visually confirming the
effectiveness of NucleusDiff in reducing separation violations and improving
binding affinities.


### Enhancing GANs with Contrastive Learning-Based Multistage Progressive Finetuning SNN and RL-Based External Optimization

**Abstract**: The application of deep learning in cancer research, particularly in early
diagnosis, case understanding, and treatment strategy design, emphasizes the
need for high-quality data. Generative AI, especially Generative Adversarial
Networks (GANs), has emerged as a leading solution to challenges like class
imbalance, robust learning, and model training, while addressing issues
stemming from patient privacy and the scarcity of real data. Despite their
promise, GANs face several challenges, both inherent and specific to
histopathology data. Inherent issues include training imbalance, mode collapse,
linear learning from insufficient discriminator feedback, and hard boundary
convergence due to stringent feedback. Histopathology data presents a unique
challenge with its complex representation, high spatial resolution, and
multiscale features. To address these challenges, we propose a framework
consisting of two components. First, we introduce a contrastive learning-based
Multistage Progressive Finetuning Siamese Neural Network (MFT-SNN) for
assessing the similarity between histopathology patches. Second, we implement a
Reinforcement Learning-based External Optimizer (RL-EO) within the GAN training
loop, serving as a reward signal generator. The modified discriminator loss
function incorporates a weighted reward, guiding the GAN to maximize this
reward while minimizing loss. This approach offers an external optimization
guide to the discriminator, preventing generator overfitting and ensuring
smooth convergence. Our proposed solution has been benchmarked against
state-of-the-art (SOTA) GANs and a Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic model,
outperforming previous SOTA across various metrics, including FID score, KID
score, Perceptual Path Length, and downstream classification tasks.


### Continuous Diffusion for Mixed-Type Tabular Data

**Abstract**: Score-based generative models (or diffusion models for short) have proven
successful for generating text and image data. However, the adaption of this
model family to tabular data of mixed-type has fallen short so far. In this
paper, we propose CDTD, a Continuous Diffusion model for mixed-type Tabular
Data. Specifically, we combine score matching and score interpolation to ensure
a common continuous noise distribution for both continuous and categorical
features alike. We counteract the high heterogeneity inherent to data of
mixed-type with distinct, adaptive noise schedules per feature or per data
type. The learnable noise schedules ensure optimally allocated model capacity
and balanced generative capability. We homogenize the data types further with
model-specific loss calibration and initialization schemes tailored to
mixed-type tabular data. Our experimental results show that CDTD consistently
outperforms state-of-the-art benchmark models, captures feature correlations
exceptionally well, and that heterogeneity in the noise schedule design boosts
the sample quality.
