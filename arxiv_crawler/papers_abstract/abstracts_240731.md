**Abstract**: Spintronic devices offer a promising avenue for the development of nanoscale,
energy-efficient artificial neurons for neuromorphic computing. It has
previously been shown that with antiferromagnetic (AFM) oscillators, ultra-fast
spiking artificial neurons can be made that mimic many unique features of
biological neurons. In this work, we train an artificial neural network of AFM
neurons to perform pattern recognition. A simple machine learning algorithm
called spike pattern association neuron (SPAN), which relies on the temporal
position of neuron spikes, is used during training. In under a microsecond of
physical time, the AFM neural network is trained to recognize symbols composed
from a grid by producing a spike within a specified time window. We further
achieve multi-symbol recognition with the addition of an output layer to
suppress undesirable spikes. Through the utilization of AFM neurons and the
SPAN algorithm, we create a neural network capable of high-accuracy recognition
with overall power consumption on the order of picojoules.

**Abstract**: Elections play a fundamental role in democratic societies, however they are
often characterized by unexpected results. Here we discuss an election campaign
model inspired by the compartmental epidemiology, and we show that the model
captures the main characteristics of an election campaign: persuasion, betrayal
and regret. All of these three factors can be used together or independently to
influence the campaign, and to determine the winner. We include results for
both the deterministic and the stochastic versions of the model, and we show
that the decision to not vote significantly increases the fluctuations in the
model, amplifying the chance of controversial results, in agreement with the
well known "paradox of not voting".

**Abstract**: Understanding how misinformation affects the spread of disease is crucial for
public health, especially given recent research indicating that misinformation
can increase vaccine hesitancy and discourage vaccine uptake. However, it is
difficult to investigate the interaction between misinformation and epidemic
outcomes due to the dearth of data-informed holistic epidemic models. Here, we
employ an epidemic model that incorporates a large, mobility-informed physical
contact network as well as the distribution of misinformed individuals across
counties derived from social media data. The model allows us to simulate and
estimate various scenarios to understand the impact of misinformation on
epidemic spreading. Using this model, we present a worst-case scenario in which
a heavily misinformed population would result in an additional 14% of the U.S.
population becoming infected over the course of the COVID-19 epidemic, compared
to a best-case scenario.


### A Diffused Background from Axion-like Particles in the Microwave Sky
**Authors**: Harsh Mehta, Suvodip Mukherjee

**Published Date**: 2024-05-14

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-30

**PDF Url**: [2405.08879v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.08879v3)

**Abstract**: The nature of dark matter is an unsolved cosmological problem and axions are
one of the weakly interacting cold dark matter candidates. Axions or ALPs
(Axion-like particles) are pseudo-scalar bosons predicted by beyond-standard
model theories. The weak coupling of ALPs with photons leads to the conversion
of CMB photons to ALPs in the presence of a transverse magnetic field. If they
have the same mass as the effective mass of a photon in a plasma, the resonant
conversion would cause a polarized spectral distortion leading to temperature
fluctuations with the distortion spectrum. The probability of resonant
conversion depends on the properties of the cluster such as the magnetic field,
electron density, and its redshift. We show that this kind of conversion can
happen in numerous unresolved galaxy clusters up to high redshifts, which will
lead to a diffused polarised anisotropy signal in the microwave sky. The
spectrum of the signal and its shape in the angular scale will be different
from the lensed CMB polarization signal. This new polarised distortion spectrum
will be correlated with the distribution of clusters in the universe and hence,
with the large-scale structure. The spectrum can then be probed using its
spectral and spatial variation with respect to the CMB and various foregrounds.
An SNR of $\sim$ 4.36 and $\sim$ 93.87 are possible in the CMB-S4 145 GHz band
and CMB-HD 150 GHz band respectively for a photon-ALPs coupling strength of
$\mathrm{g_{a \gamma} = 10^{-12} \, GeV^{-1}}$ using galaxy clusters beyond
redshift z $= 1$. The same signal would lead to additional RMS fluctuations of
$\sim \mathrm{7.5 \times 10^{-2} \, \mu K}$ at 145 GHz. In the absence of any
signal, future CMB experiments such as Simons Observatory (SO), CMB-S4, and
CMB-HD can put constraints on coupling strength better than current bounds from
particle physics experiment CERN Axion Solar Telescope (CAST).


### An iterative transversal CNOT decoder
**Authors**: Kwok Ho Wan, Mark Webber, Austin G. Fowler, Winfried K. Hensinger

**PDF Url**: [2407.20976v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20976v1)

**Abstract**: Modern platforms for potential qubit candidates, such as trapped ions or
neutral atoms, allow long range connectivity between distant physical qubits
through shuttling. This opens up an avenue for transversal logical CNOT gates
between distant logical qubits, whereby physical CNOT gates are performed
between each corresponding physical qubit on the control and target logical
qubits. However, the transversal CNOT can propagate errors from one logical
qubit to another, leading to correlated errors between logical qubits. We have
developed a multi-pass iterative decoder that decodes each logical qubit
separately to deal with this correlated error. We show that under circuit-level
noise and only $\mathcal{O}(1)$ code cycles, a threshold can still persist, and
the logical error rate will not be significantly degraded, matching the
sub-threshold logical error rate scaling of $p^{\lfloor\frac{d}{2}\rfloor}$ for
a distance $d$ rotated surface code.


### Transfer Learning for Multi-material Classification of Transition Metal Dichalcogenides with Atomic Force Microscopy

**Abstract**: Deep learning models are widely used for the data-driven design of materials
based on atomic force microscopy (AFM) and other scanning probe microscopy.
These tools enhance efficiency in inverse design and characterization of
materials. However, limited and imbalanced experimental materials data
typically available is a major challenge. Also important is the need to
interpret trained models, which have typically been complex enough to be
uninterpretable by humans. Here, we present a systemic evaluation of transfer
learning strategies to accommodate low-data scenarios in materials synthesis
and a model latent feature analysis to draw connections to the
human-interpretable characteristics of the samples. Our models show accurate
predictions in five classes of transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs)
(MoS$_2$, WS$_2$, WSe$_2$, MoSe$_2$, and Mo-WSe$_2$) with up to 89$\%$ accuracy
on held-out test samples. Analysis of the latent features reveals a correlation
with physical characteristics such as grain density, DoG blob, and local
variation. The transfer learning optimization modality and the exploration of
the correlation between the latent and physical features provide important
frameworks that can be applied to other classes of materials beyond TMDs to
enhance the models' performance and explainability which can accelerate the
inverse design of materials for technological applications.


### GeV scale dark matter and $B\rightarrow K+$ missing energy phenomenology in the $U(1)_{B-L}$ model
**Authors**: Ajay Kumar Yadav, Shivaramakrishna Singirala, Manas Kumar Mohapatra, Suchismita Sahoo

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-30

**PDF Url**: [2407.20974v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20974v1)

**Abstract**: We elucidate the recently observed discrepancy in the branching ratio of
$B^{+}\rightarrow K^{+}$ +inv decay mode using a GeV scale scalar dark matter
in an anomaly-free $U(1)_{B-L}$ gauge extension of the Standard Model. We
constrain the new parameters by using consistency with the existing bounds on
Dark matter relic density, direct detection, collider and BR($B\rightarrow
K^*\nu\bar{\nu}$) measured at the Belle II experiment. We investigate couplings
between the mediator and the SM fermions as well as the dark matter particle.
We then estimate the branching ratios of $b \to s \nu \bar \nu$ decay processes
such as $B\rightarrow (K^+,K^*)\nu\bar{\nu}$, $B_s\rightarrow
(\eta,\eta')\nu\bar{\nu}$, $ B_s\rightarrow \phi\nu\bar{\nu}$ and
$B_c\rightarrow (D_s, D_s^*)\nu\bar{\nu}$ in a common parameter space, meeting
the current experimental bounds of both sectors simultaneously.

**Authors**: Jiaxing Zhao, Joerg Aichelin, Pol Bernard Gossiaux, Klaus Werner

**Published Date**: 2024-07-30

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-30

**PDF Url**: [2407.20919v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20919v1)

**Abstract**: We study the system size dependence of heavy quark (HQ) observables at a
center of mass energy of $\sqrt{s_{\rm NN}}=5.02$ TeV to explore whether it can
provide further constraints on the physical processes which are involved:
energy loss of HQs in the quark gluon plasma (QGP), hadronization and hadronic
rescattering. We use the EPOS4HQ approach to study p-p and 0-10\% central O-O,
Ar-Ar, Kr-Kr and Pb-Pb reactions and investigate in detail the momentum change
of heavy quarks from creation until their detection as part of a hadron as well
as the enhancement of heavy baryon production at low $p_T$. We investigate
furthermore the origin and the system size dependence of the azimuthal
correlations between the heavy quark $Q$ and the heavy antiquark $\bar Q$ and
how one can bypass the problem that correlations are washed out due to the
combinatorial background. We conclude that a systematic study of the system
size dependence of the momentum loss allows to separate the momentum loss due
to the passage through the QGP from the momentum change due to hadronization
and the $Q\bar Q$ correlations allow to gain inside into the different pQCD
processes in which the heavy quarks are created.


### A parametrically programmable delay line for microwave photons
**Authors**: Takuma Makihara, Nathan Lee, Yudan Guo, Wenyan Guan, Amir H. Safavi-Naeini

**Published Date**: 2024-01-09

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-30

**PDF Url**: [2401.04724v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.04724v3)

**Abstract**: Delay lines that store quantum information are crucial for advancing quantum
repeaters and hardware efficient quantum computers. Traditionally, they are
realized as extended systems that support wave propagation but provide limited
control over the propagating fields. Here, we introduce a parametrically
addressed delay line for microwave photons that provides a high level of
control over the stored pulses. By parametrically driving a three-wave mixing
circuit element that is weakly hybridized with an ensemble of resonators, we
engineer a spectral response that simulates that of a physical delay line,
while providing fast control over the delay line's properties. We demonstrate
this novel degree of control by choosing which photon echo to emit, translating
pulses in time, and even swapping two pulses, all with pulse energies on the
order of a single photon. We also measure the noise added from our parametric
interactions and find it is much less than one photon.

**PDF Url**: [2206.06698v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06698v2)

**Abstract**: We present a simple model of composite particle tunnelling through a
rectangular potential barrier in presence of magnetic field. The exact
numerical solution of the problem is provided and the applicability to real
physical situations is discussed. Some qualitative features of tunnelling with
no magnetic interaction are retained, but some new ones are also observed. The
resonance peaks in transmission spectrum generally do not reach $100\%$
transmission probability when the magnetic field is turned on. We observe
splitting and in some cases widening of transmission probability peaks. When
the width $b$ of area with magnetic field is large, we observe oscillations of
spin-flip probability with energy and $b$ which are caused by Larmor precession
of spin about the vector of magnetic field. For some values of relevant
parameters we also observe significant increase of tunnelling probability for
low energies in the single particle case.

### On the Exploitation of DCT-Traces in the Generative-AI Domain
**Authors**: Orazio Pontorno, Luca Guarnera, Sebastiano Battiato

**PDF Url**: [2402.02209v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.02209v3)

**Abstract**: Deepfakes represent one of the toughest challenges in the world of
Cybersecurity and Digital Forensics, especially considering the high-quality
results obtained with recent generative AI-based solutions. Almost all
generative models leave unique traces in synthetic data that, if analyzed and
identified in detail, can be exploited to improve the generalization
limitations of existing deepfake detectors. In this paper we analyzed deepfake
images in the frequency domain generated by both GAN and Diffusion Model
engines, examining in detail the underlying statistical distribution of
Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) coefficients. Recognizing that not all
coefficients contribute equally to image detection, we hypothesize the
existence of a unique ``discriminative fingerprint", embedded in specific
combinations of coefficients. To identify them, Machine Learning classifiers
were trained on various combinations of coefficients. In addition, the
Explainable AI (XAI) LIME algorithm was used to search for intrinsic
discriminative combinations of coefficients. Finally, we performed a robustness
test to analyze the persistence of traces by applying JPEG compression. The
experimental results reveal the existence of traces left by the generative
models that are more discriminative and persistent at JPEG attacks. Code and
dataset are available at https://github.com/opontorno/dcts_analysis_deepfakes.


### Light and Optimal Schrödinger Bridge Matching
**Authors**: Nikita Gushchin, Sergei Kholkin, Evgeny Burnaev, Alexander Korotin

**Published Date**: 2024-02-05

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-30

**PDF Url**: [2402.03207v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.03207v2)

**Abstract**: Schr\"odinger Bridges (SB) have recently gained the attention of the ML
community as a promising extension of classic diffusion models which is also
interconnected to the Entropic Optimal Transport (EOT). Recent solvers for SB
exploit the pervasive bridge matching procedures. Such procedures aim to
recover a stochastic process transporting the mass between distributions given
only a transport plan between them. In particular, given the EOT plan, these
procedures can be adapted to solve SB. This fact is heavily exploited by recent
works giving rise to matching-based SB solvers. The cornerstone here is
recovering the EOT plan: recent works either use heuristical approximations
(e.g., the minibatch OT) or establish iterative matching procedures which by
the design accumulate the error during the training. We address these
limitations and propose a novel procedure to learn SB which we call the
\textbf{optimal Schr\"odinger bridge matching}. It exploits the optimal
parameterization of the diffusion process and provably recovers the SB process
\textbf{(a)} with a single bridge matching step and \textbf{(b)} with arbitrary
transport plan as the input. Furthermore, we show that the optimal bridge
matching objective coincides with the recently discovered energy-based modeling
(EBM) objectives to learn EOT/SB. Inspired by this observation, we develop a
light solver (which we call LightSB-M) to implement optimal matching in
practice using the Gaussian mixture parameterization of the adjusted
Schr\"odinger potential. We experimentally showcase the performance of our
solver in a range of practical tasks. The code for our solver can be found at
https://github.com/SKholkin/LightSB-Matching.


### Diffusion Augmented Agents: A Framework for Efficient Exploration and Transfer Learning
**Authors**: Norman Di Palo, Leonard Hasenclever, Jan Humplik, Arunkumar Byravan

**Published Date**: 2024-07-30

**PDF Url**: [2407.20798v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20798v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce Diffusion Augmented Agents (DAAG), a novel framework that
leverages large language models, vision language models, and diffusion models
to improve sample efficiency and transfer learning in reinforcement learning
for embodied agents. DAAG hindsight relabels the agent's past experience by
using diffusion models to transform videos in a temporally and geometrically
consistent way to align with target instructions with a technique we call
Hindsight Experience Augmentation. A large language model orchestrates this
autonomous process without requiring human supervision, making it well-suited
for lifelong learning scenarios. The framework reduces the amount of
reward-labeled data needed to 1) finetune a vision language model that acts as
a reward detector, and 2) train RL agents on new tasks. We demonstrate the
sample efficiency gains of DAAG in simulated robotics environments involving
manipulation and navigation. Our results show that DAAG improves learning of
reward detectors, transferring past experience, and acquiring new tasks - key
abilities for developing efficient lifelong learning agents. Supplementary

**PDF Url**: [2310.01690v7](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2310.01690v7)

**Abstract**: As tropical cyclones become more intense due to climate change, the rise of
Al-based modelling provides a more affordable and accessible approach compared
to traditional methods based on mathematical models. This work leverages
generative diffusion models to forecast cyclone trajectories and precipitation
patterns by integrating satellite imaging, remote sensing, and atmospheric
data. It employs a cascaded approach that incorporates three main tasks:
forecasting, super-resolution, and precipitation modelling. The training
dataset includes 51 cyclones from six major tropical cyclone basins from
January 2019 - March 2023. Experiments demonstrate that the final forecasts
from the cascaded models show accurate predictions up to a 36-hour rollout,
with excellent Structural Similarity (SSIM) and Peak-Singal-To-Noise Ratio
(PSNR) values exceeding 0.5 and 20 dB, respectively, for all three tasks. The
36-hour forecasts can be produced in as little as 30 mins on a single Nvidia
A30/RTX 2080 Ti. This work also highlights the promising efficiency of Al
methods such as diffusion models for high-performance needs in weather
forecasting, such as tropical cyclone forecasting, while remaining
computationally affordable, making them ideal for highly vulnerable regions
with critical forecasting needs and financial limitations. Code accessible at

### Joint Diffusion Processes as an Inductive Bias in Sheaf Neural Networks
**Authors**: Ferran Hernandez Caralt, Guillermo Bernárdez Gil, Iulia Duta, Pietro Liò, Eduard Alarcón Cot

**Published Date**: 2024-07-30

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-30

**PDF Url**: [2407.20597v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20597v1)

**Abstract**: Sheaf Neural Networks (SNNs) naturally extend Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) by
endowing a cellular sheaf over the graph, equipping nodes and edges with vector
spaces and defining linear mappings between them. While the attached geometric
structure has proven to be useful in analyzing heterophily and oversmoothing,
so far the methods by which the sheaf is computed do not always guarantee a
good performance in such settings. In this work, drawing inspiration from
opinion dynamics concepts, we propose two novel sheaf learning approaches that
(i) provide a more intuitive understanding of the involved structure maps, (ii)
introduce a useful inductive bias for heterophily and oversmoothing, and (iii)
infer the sheaf in a way that does not scale with the number of features, thus
using fewer learnable parameters than existing methods. In our evaluation, we
show the limitations of the real-world benchmarks used so far on SNNs, and
design a new synthetic task -- leveraging the symmetries of n-dimensional
ellipsoids -- that enables us to better assess the strengths and weaknesses of
sheaf-based models. Our extensive experimentation on these novel datasets
reveals valuable insights into the scenarios and contexts where SNNs in general
-- and our proposed approaches in particular -- can be beneficial.

**PDF Url**: [2407.19858v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19858v1)

**Abstract**: In the field of quantitative finance, machine learning methods have become
essential for alpha generation. This paper presents a pioneering method that
uniquely combines Hidden Markov Models (HMM) and neural networks, creating a
dual-model alpha generation system integrated with Black-Litterman portfolio
optimization. The methodology, implemented on the QuantConnect platform, aims
to predict future price movements and optimize trading strategies.
Specifically, it filters for highly liquid, top-cap energy stocks to ensure
stable and predictable performance while also accounting for broker payments.
QuantConnect was selected because of its robust framework and to guarantee
experimental reproducibility. The algorithm achieved a 31% return between June
1, 2023, and January 1, 2024, with a Sharpe ratio of 1.669, demonstrating its
potential. The findings suggest significant improvements in trading strategy
performance through the combined use of the HMM and neural networks. This study
explores the architecture of the algorithm, data pre-processing techniques,
model training procedures, and performance evaluation, highlighting its
practical applicability and effectiveness in real-world trading environments.

**Authors**: George Fragiadakis, Christos Diou, George Kousiouris, Mara Nikolaidou

**Published Date**: 2024-07-09

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-09

**PDF Url**: [2407.19098v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.19098v1)

**Abstract**: The use of artificial intelligence (AI) in working environments with
individuals, known as Human-AI Collaboration (HAIC), has become essential in a
variety of domains, boosting decision-making, efficiency, and innovation.
Despite HAIC's wide potential, evaluating its effectiveness remains challenging
due to the complex interaction of components involved.
  This paper provides a detailed analysis of existing HAIC evaluation
approaches and develops a fresh paradigm for more effectively evaluating these
systems.
  Our framework includes a structured decision tree which assists to select
relevant metrics based on distinct HAIC modes (AI-Centric, Human-Centric, and
Symbiotic). By including both quantitative and qualitative metrics, the
framework seeks to represent HAIC's dynamic and reciprocal nature, enabling the
assessment of its impact and success. This framework's practicality can be
examined by its application in an array of domains, including manufacturing,
healthcare, finance, and education, each of which has unique challenges and
requirements. Our hope is that this study will facilitate further research on
the systematic evaluation of HAIC in real-world applications.
