**Abstract**: For any local, translation-covariant quantum field theory on Minkowski
spacetime, we prove that two distinct states that are invariant under the
inertial time evolutions in different inertial reference frames are disjoint,
i.e. neither state is a perturbation of the other, if the states are primary,
have separating Gelfand-Naimark-Segal (GNS) vectors, and satisfy a timelike
cluster property called the mixing property. These conditions are fulfilled by
the inertial Kubo-Martin-Schwinger (KMS) states of the free scalar field, thus
showing that a state satisfying the KMS condition relative to one inertial
frame is far from thermal equilibrium relative to other inertial frames. We
review the property of return to equilibrium (RTE) in open quantum systems
theory and discuss the implications of disjointness on the asymptotic behavior
of detector systems coupled to states of a free massless scalar field. We argue
that the coupled system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector moving with constant
velocity relative to the field in a KMS state, or an excitation thereof, cannot
thermalize under generic conditions. This leads to an illustration of the
physical differences between heat baths in inertial systems and the alleged
"heat bath" of the Unruh effect. This paper also sketches the construction and
RTE property of the quantum dynamical system of an Unruh-DeWitt detector
coupled to a massless scalar field in a KMS state relative to the inertial rest
frame of the detector.

**PDF Url**: [2409.12955v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12955v1)

**Abstract**: We report the rotationally resolved spectrum of a single polyatomic molecular
ion in the gas phase. Building upon the recently developed inelastic recoil
spectroscopy (IRS) technique, we have achieved a spectral resolution sufficient
to observe resolved rotational-vibrational transitions of a trapped
cyclopropenyl cation, c-C3H3+. The high precision of IRS shown in this work
presents an attractive platform for astrochemistry, single molecule chiral
detection, and tests of fundamental physics.

**Authors**: Mohammad Mahdi Altakach, Sabine Kraml, Andre Lessa, Sahana Narasimha, Timothée Pascal, Camila Ramos, Yoxara Villamizar, Wolfgang Waltenberger

**Published Date**: 2024-09-19

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2409.12942v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12942v1)

**Abstract**: SModelS is a public tool for fast reinterpretation of LHC searches for new
physics based on a large database of simplified model results. While previous
versions were limited to models with a Z2-type symmetry, such as R-parity
conserving supersymmetry, version 3 can now handle arbitrary signal topologies.
To this end, the tool was fully restructured and now relies on a graph-based
description of simplified model topologies. In this work, we present the main
conceptual changes and novel features of SModelS v3, together with the
inclusion of new experimental searches for resonant production of spin-1 and
spin-0 mediators with decays to quarks or to dark matter. Applying these
results to a model containing two mediators, we discuss the interplay of
resonance and missing energy searches, and the model's coverage by the
currently available simplified model results.


### Shaping Dark Photon Spectral Distortions
**Authors**: Giorgi Arsenadze, Andrea Caputo, Xucheng Gan, Hongwan Liu, Joshua T. Ruderman

**Published Date**: 2024-09-19

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2409.12940v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12940v1)

**Abstract**: The cosmic microwave background (CMB) spectrum is an extraordinary tool for
exploring physics beyond the Standard Model. The exquisite precision of the
measurement makes it particularly sensitive to small effects caused by hidden
sector interactions. In particular, CMB spectral distortions can unveil the
existence of dark photons which are kinetically coupled to the standard photon.
In this work, we use the COBE-FIRAS dataset to derive accurate and robust
limits on photon-to-dark-photon oscillations for a large range of dark photon
masses, from $10^{-10}$ to $10^{-4}$ eV. We consider in detail the redshift
dependence of the bounds, computing CMB distortions due to photon
injection/removal using a Green's function method. Our treatment improves on
previous results, which had set limits studying energy injection/removal into
baryons rather than photon injection/removal, or ignored the redshift evolution
of distortions. The difference between our treatment and previous ones is
particularly noticeable in the predicted spectral shape of the distortions, a
smoking gun signature for photon-to-dark-photon oscillations. The
characterization of the spectral shape is crucial for future CMB missions,
which could improve the present sensitivity by orders of magnitude, exploring
regions of the dark photon parameter space that are otherwise difficult to
access.


### Corner and Edge States in Topological Sierpinski Carpet Systems
**Authors**: L. L. Lage, N. C. Rappe, A. Latgé

**Published Date**: 2024-03-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2403.13774v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.13774v3)

**Abstract**: Fractal lattices, with their self-similar and intricate structures, offer
potential platforms for engineering physical properties on the nanoscale and
also for realizing and manipulating high order topological insulator states in
novel ways. Here we present a theoretical study on localized corner and edge
states, emerging from topological phases in Sierpinski Carpet within a
$\pi$-flux regime. A topological phase diagram is presented correlating the
quadrupole moment with different hopping parameters. Particular localized
states are identified following spatial signatures in distinct fractal
generations. The specific geometry and scaling properties of the fractal
systems can guide the supported topological states types and their associated
functionalities. A conductive device is proposed by coupling identical
Sierpinski Carpet units providing transport response through projected edge
states which carry on the details of the system's topology. Our findings
suggest that fractal lattices may also work as alternative routes to tune
energy channels in different devices.


### The Streda Formula for Floquet Systems: Topological Invariants and Quantized Anomalies from Cesaro Summation
**Authors**: Lucila Peralta Gavensky, Gonzalo Usaj, Nathan Goldman

**Published Date**: 2024-08-24

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2408.13576v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.13576v2)

**Abstract**: This work introduces a general theoretical framework, which expresses the
topological invariants of two-dimensional Floquet systems in terms of tractable
response functions: Building on the Sambe representation of periodically-driven
systems, and inspired by the St\v{r}eda formula for static systems, we evaluate
the flow of the unbounded Floquet density of states in response to a magnetic
perturbation. This Floquet-St\v{r}eda response, which is a priori
mathematically ill-defined, is regularized by means of a Ces\`aro summation
method. As a key outcome of this approach, we relate all relevant Floquet
winding numbers to simple band properties of the Floquet-Bloch Hamiltonian.
These general relations indicate how the topological characterization of
Floquet systems can be entirely deduced from the stroboscopic time-evolution of
the driven system. Importantly, we identify two physically distinguishable
contributions to the Floquet-St\v{r}eda response: a quantized flow of charge
between the edge and the bulk of the system, and an 'anomalous' quantized flow
of energy between the system and the driving field, which provides new insight
on the physical origin of the anomalous edge states. As byproducts, our theory
provides: a general relation between Floquet winding numbers and the orbital
magnetization of Floquet-Bloch bands; a local marker for Floquet winding
numbers, which allows to access Floquet topology in inhomogeneous samples; an
experimental protocol to extract these Floquet winding numbers from
density-measurements in the presence of an engineered bath; as well as general
expressions for these topological invariants in terms of the magnetic response
of the Floquet density of states, opening a route for the topological
characterization of interacting Floquet systems.


### Hard Thermal Loop -- theory and applications
**Authors**: Najmul Haque, Munshi G. Mustafa

**Published Date**: 2024-04-12

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2404.08734v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.08734v2)

**Abstract**: In this review, we present the key aspects of modern thermal perturbation
theory based on the hard thermal loop (HTL) approximation, including its
theoretical foundations and applications within quantum electrodynamics (QED)
and quantum chromodynamics (QCD) plasmas. To maintain conciseness, we focus on
scenarios in thermal equilibrium, examining a variety of physical quantities
and settings. Specifically, we explore both bulk thermodynamic properties and
real-time observables in high-temperature domains relevant to heavy-ion
physics.


### Physics aware machine learning for micromagnetic energy minimization: recent algorithmic developments
**Authors**: Sebastian Schaffer, Thomas Schrefl, Harald Oezelt, Norbert J Mauser, Lukas Exl

**Published Date**: 2024-09-19

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2409.12877v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12877v1)

**Abstract**: In this work, we explore advanced machine learning techniques for minimizing
Gibbs free energy in full 3D micromagnetic simulations. Building on Brown's
bounds for magnetostatic self-energy, we revisit their application in the
context of variational formulations of the transmission problems for the scalar
and vector potential. To overcome the computational challenges posed by
whole-space integrals, we reformulate these bounds on a finite domain, making
the method more efficient and scalable for numerical simulation. Our approach
utilizes an alternating optimization scheme for joint minimization of Brown's
energy bounds and the Gibbs free energy. The Cayley transform is employed to
rigorously enforce the unit norm constraint, while R-functions are used to
impose essential boundary conditions in the computation of magnetostatic
fields. Our results highlight the potential of mesh-free Physics-Informed
Neural Networks (PINNs) and Extreme Learning Machines (ELMs) when integrated
with hard constraints, providing highly accurate approximations. These methods
exhibit competitive performance compared to traditional numerical approaches,
showing significant promise in computing magnetostatic fields and the
application for energy minimization, such as the computation of hysteresis
curves. This work opens the path for future directions of research on more
complex geometries, such as grain structure models, and the application to
large scale problem settings which are intractable with traditional numerical
methods.


### Flavor Hierarchy of Jet Energy Correlators inside the Quark-Gluon Plasma
**Authors**: Wen-Jing Xing, Shanshan Cao, Guang-You Qin, Xin-Nian Wang

**Published Date**: 2024-09-19

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2409.12843v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12843v1)

**Abstract**: Heavy flavor jets provide ideal tools to probe the mass effect on jet
substructure in both vacuum and quark-gluon plasma (QGP). Energy-energy
correlator (EEC) is an excellent jet substructure observable owning to its
strong sensitivity to jet physics at different scales. We perform a complete
realistic simulation on medium modification of heavy and light flavor jet EEC
in heavy-ion collisions. A clear flavor hierarchy is observed for jet EEC in
both vacuum and QGP due to the mass effect. The medium modification of
inclusive jet EEC at different angular scales exhibits very rich structure:
suppression at intermediate angles, and enhancement at small and large angles,
which can be well explained by the interplay of mass effect, energy loss,
medium-induced radiation and medium response. These unique features of jet EEC
are shown to probe the physics of jet-medium interaction at different scales,
and can be readily validated by upcoming experiments.

**Authors**: Aritra Lahiri, Sang-Jun Choi, Björn Trauzettel

**Published Date**: 2024-02-20

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2402.13074v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13074v2)

**Abstract**: The Higgs mode in superconductors corresponds to oscillations of the
amplitude of the order parameter. While its detection typically entails
resonant optical excitation, we present a purely transport-based setup wherein
it is excited in a voltage biased Josephson junction. Demonstrating the
importance of order parameter dynamics, the interplay of Higgs resonance and
Josephson physics enhances the second harmonic Josephson current oscillating at
twice the usual Josephson frequency in transparent junctions featuring
single-band s-wave superconductors. If the leads have unequal equilibrium
superconducting gaps, this second harmonic component may even eclipse its first
harmonic counterpart, thus furnishing a unique hallmark of the Higgs
oscillations.


## Diffusion
### Exploring Privacy and Fairness Risks in Sharing Diffusion Models: An Adversarial Perspective
**Authors**: Xinjian Luo, Yangfan Jiang, Fei Wei, Yuncheng Wu, Xiaokui Xiao, Beng Chin Ooi

**Published Date**: 2024-02-28

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2402.18607v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18607v3)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have recently gained significant attention in both academia
and industry due to their impressive generative performance in terms of both
sampling quality and distribution coverage. Accordingly, proposals are made for
sharing pre-trained diffusion models across different organizations, as a way
of improving data utilization while enhancing privacy protection by avoiding
sharing private data directly. However, the potential risks associated with
such an approach have not been comprehensively examined.
  In this paper, we take an adversarial perspective to investigate the
potential privacy and fairness risks associated with the sharing of diffusion
models. Specifically, we investigate the circumstances in which one party (the
sharer) trains a diffusion model using private data and provides another party
(the receiver) black-box access to the pre-trained model for downstream tasks.
We demonstrate that the sharer can execute fairness poisoning attacks to
undermine the receiver's downstream models by manipulating the training data
distribution of the diffusion model. Meanwhile, the receiver can perform
property inference attacks to reveal the distribution of sensitive features in
the sharer's dataset. Our experiments conducted on real-world datasets
demonstrate remarkable attack performance on different types of diffusion
models, which highlights the critical importance of robust data auditing and
privacy protection protocols in pertinent applications.


### ViolinDiff: Enhancing Expressive Violin Synthesis with Pitch Bend Conditioning
**Authors**: Daewoong Kim, Hao-Wen Dong, Dasaem Jeong

**Published Date**: 2024-09-19

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2409.12477v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12477v1)

**Abstract**: Modeling the natural contour of fundamental frequency (F0) plays a critical
role in music audio synthesis. However, transcribing and managing multiple F0
contours in polyphonic music is challenging, and explicit F0 contour modeling
has not yet been explored for polyphonic instrumental synthesis. In this paper,
we present ViolinDiff, a two-stage diffusion-based synthesis framework. For a
given violin MIDI file, the first stage estimates the F0 contour as pitch bend
information, and the second stage generates mel spectrogram incorporating these
expressive details. The quantitative metrics and listening test results show
that the proposed model generates more realistic violin sounds than the model
without explicit pitch bend modeling. Audio samples are available online:

**Published Date**: 2024-09-19

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2409.12471v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12471v1)

**Abstract**: Building on the foundations of our previous work, this paper introduces Arena
4.0, a significant advancement over Arena 3.0, Arena-Bench, Arena 1.0, and
Arena 2.0. Arena 4.0 offers three key novel contributions: (1) a
generative-model-based world and scenario generation approach that utilizes
large language models (LLMs) and diffusion models to dynamically generate
complex, human-centric environments from text prompts or 2D floorplans, useful
for the development and benchmarking of social navigation strategies; (2) a
comprehensive 3D model database, extendable with additional 3D assets that are
semantically linked and annotated for dynamic spawning and arrangement within
3D worlds; and (3) a complete migration to ROS 2, enabling compatibility with
modern hardware and enhanced functionalities for improved navigation,
usability, and easier deployment on real robots. We evaluated the platform's
performance through a comprehensive user study, demonstrating significant
improvements in usability and efficiency compared to previous versions. Arena
4.0 is openly available at https://github.com/Arena-Rosnav.


### FlexiTex: Enhancing Texture Generation with Visual Guidance
**Authors**: DaDong Jiang, Xianghui Yang, Zibo Zhao, Sheng Zhang, Jiaao Yu, Zeqiang Lai, Shaoxiong Yang, Chunchao Guo, Xiaobo Zhou, Zhihui Ke

**Published Date**: 2024-09-19

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2409.12431v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12431v1)

**Abstract**: Recent texture generation methods achieve impressive results due to the
powerful generative prior they leverage from large-scale text-to-image
diffusion models. However, abstract textual prompts are limited in providing
global textural or shape information, which results in the texture generation
methods producing blurry or inconsistent patterns. To tackle this, we present
FlexiTex, embedding rich information via visual guidance to generate a
high-quality texture. The core of FlexiTex is the Visual Guidance Enhancement
module, which incorporates more specific information from visual guidance to
reduce ambiguity in the text prompt and preserve high-frequency details. To
further enhance the visual guidance, we introduce a Direction-Aware Adaptation
module that automatically designs direction prompts based on different camera
poses, avoiding the Janus problem and maintaining semantically global
consistency. Benefiting from the visual guidance, FlexiTex produces
quantitatively and qualitatively sound results, demonstrating its potential to
advance texture generation for real-world applications.


### SeisFusion: Constrained Diffusion Model with Input Guidance for 3D Seismic Data Interpolation and Reconstruction

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-19

**PDF Url**: [2403.11482v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.11482v2)

**Abstract**: Geographical, physical, or economic constraints often result in missing
traces within seismic data, making the reconstruction of complete seismic data
a crucial step in seismic data processing. Traditional methods for seismic data
reconstruction require the selection of multiple empirical parameters and
struggle to handle large-scale continuous missing data. With the development of
deep learning, various neural networks have demonstrated powerful
reconstruction capabilities. However, these convolutional neural networks
represent a point-to-point reconstruction approach that may not cover the
entire distribution of the dataset. Consequently, when dealing with seismic
data featuring complex missing patterns, such networks may experience varying
degrees of performance degradation. In response to this challenge, we propose a
novel diffusion model reconstruction framework tailored for 3D seismic data. To
constrain the results generated by the diffusion model, we introduce
conditional supervision constraints into the diffusion model, constraining the
generated data of the diffusion model based on the input data to be
reconstructed. We introduce a 3D neural network architecture into the diffusion
model, successfully extending the 2D diffusion model to 3D space. Additionally,
we refine the model's generation process by incorporating missing data into the
generation process, resulting in reconstructions with higher consistency.
Through ablation studies determining optimal parameter values, our method
exhibits superior reconstruction accuracy when applied to both field datasets
and synthetic datasets, effectively addressing a wide range of complex missing
patterns. Our implementation is available at

## Quantitative Finance
### A Multi-agent Market Model Can Explain the Impact of AI Traders in Financial Markets -- A New Microfoundations of GARCH model
**Authors**: Kei Nakagawa, Masanori Hirano, Kentaro Minami, Takanobu Mizuta

**PDF Url**: [2409.12516v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.12516v1)

**Abstract**: The AI traders in financial markets have sparked significant interest in
their effects on price formation mechanisms and market volatility, raising
important questions for market stability and regulation. Despite this interest,
a comprehensive model to quantitatively assess the specific impacts of AI
traders remains undeveloped. This study aims to address this gap by modeling
the influence of AI traders on market price formation and volatility within a
multi-agent framework, leveraging the concept of microfoundations.
Microfoundations involve understanding macroeconomic phenomena, such as market
price formation, through the decision-making and interactions of individual
economic agents. While widely acknowledged in macroeconomics, microfoundational
approaches remain unexplored in empirical finance, particularly for models like
the GARCH model, which captures key financial statistical properties such as
volatility clustering and fat tails. This study proposes a multi-agent market
model to derive the microfoundations of the GARCH model, incorporating three
types of agents: noise traders, fundamental traders, and AI traders. By
mathematically aggregating the micro-structure of these agents, we establish
the microfoundations of the GARCH model. We validate this model through
multi-agent simulations, confirming its ability to reproduce the stylized facts
of financial markets. Finally, we analyze the impact of AI traders using
parameters derived from these microfoundations, contributing to a deeper
understanding of their role in market dynamics.
