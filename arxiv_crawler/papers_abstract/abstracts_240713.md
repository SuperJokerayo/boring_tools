**Abstract**: Massive particles produced during inflation impact soft limits of primordial
correlators. Searching for these signatures presents an exciting opportunity to
uncover the particle spectrum in the inflationary epoch. We present
non-perturbative methods to constrain intermediate-mass scalars ($0\leq
m/H<3/2$, where $H$ is the inflationary Hubble scale) produced during
inflation, which give rise to a power-law scaling in the squeezed primordial
bispectrum. Exploiting the large-scale structure consistency relations and the
separate universe approach, we derive models for the late-time squeezed matter
bispectrum and collapsed matter trispectrum sourced by these fields. To
validate our models, we run $N$-body simulations with the "Cosmological
Collider" squeezed bispectrum for two different particle masses. Our models
yield unbiased constraints on the amplitude of non-Gaussianity, $f_{\rm
NL}^{\Delta}$, from the squeezed bispectrum and collapsed trispectrum deep into
the non-linear regime ($k_{\rm max}\approx 2~h/{\rm Mpc}$ at $z=0$). We assess
the information content of these summary statistics, emphasizing the importance
of sample variance cancellation in the matter sector. We also study the
scale-dependent halo bias in our simulations. For mass-selected halos, the
non-Gaussian bias estimated from our simulations agrees with predictions based
on (i) separate universe simulations and (ii) universal mass functions. With
further work, these results can be used to search for inflationary massive
particle production with upcoming galaxy surveys.

**Abstract**: Three-body dynamics above threshold is required for the reliable extraction
of many amplitudes and resonances from experiment and lattice QCD. The S-matrix
principle of unitarity can be used to construct dynamical coupled-channel
approaches in which three particles scatter off each other, re-arranging
two-body subsystems by particle exchange. This paper reports the development of
a three-body coupled-channel, amplitude including pions and kaons. The
unequal-mass amplitude contains two-body S- and P-wave subsystems ("isobars")
of all isospins, $I=0,\,1/2,\,1,\, 3/2, \, 2$, and it also allows for
transitions within a given isobar. The $f_0(500)\,
("\sigma"),\,f_0(980),\,\rho(700), K_0^*(700)\,("\kappa")$, and $K^*(892)$
resonances are included, apart from repulsive isobars. Different methods to
evaluate the amplitude for physical momenta are discussed. Production
amplitudes for $a_1$ quantum numbers are shown as a proof of principle for the
numerical implementation.

**Abstract**: Anomaly detection is a promising, model-agnostic strategy to find physics
beyond the Standard Model. State-of-the-art machine learning methods offer
impressive performance on anomaly detection tasks, but interpretability,
resource, and memory concerns motivate considering a wide range of
alternatives. We explore using the 2-Wasserstein distance from optimal
transport theory, both as an anomaly score and as input to interpretable
machine learning methods, for event-level anomaly detection at the Large Hadron
Collider. The choice of ground space plays a key role in optimizing
performance. We comment on the feasibility of implementing these methods in the
L1 trigger system.

**Abstract**: In this paper we continue our study of the scientific research carried out at
the Institute of Physics of the National University of La Plata during the
first half of the 20th century, and of the important role played by the
physicist Ramon G. Loyarte. Based on his studies, alone or in collaboration
with members of the Institute, towards the end of the 1920s Loyarte proposed
the possible existence of a new quantum of rotational energy in the mercury
atom. This idea raised criticism and generated a fierce scientific controversy
that reached the national and international academic media. We analyse this
controversy by studying the comments that appeared in international review
journals. We also study Loyarte's activities in politics and science policy in
Argentina in the 1930s and 1940s, where he was responsible for interesting
political and scientific initiatives.

**Abstract**: Estimating a quantum phase is a necessary task in a wide range of fields of
quantum science. To accomplish this task, two well-known methods have been
developed in distinct contexts, namely, Ramsey interferometry (RI) in atomic
and molecular physics and quantum phase estimation (QPE) in quantum computing.
We demonstrate that these canonical examples are instances of a larger class of
phase estimation protocols, which we call reductive quantum phase estimation
(RQPE) circuits. Here we present an explicit algorithm that allows one to
create an RQPE circuit. This circuit distinguishes an arbitrary set of phases
with a fewer number of qubits and unitary applications, thereby solving a
general class of quantum hypothesis testing to which RI and QPE belong. We
further demonstrate a trade-off between measurement precision and phase
distinguishability, which allows one to tune the circuit to be optimal for a
specific application.

**Abstract**: One of the most counterintuitive aspects of quantum theory is its claim that
there is 'intrinsic' randomness in the physical world. Quantum information
science has greatly progressed in the study of intrinsic, or secret, quantum
randomness in the past decade. With much emphasis on device-independent and
semi-device-independent bounds, one of the most basic questions has escaped
attention: how much intrinsic randomness can be extracted from a given state
$\rho$, and what measurements achieve this bound? We answer this question for
three different randomness quantifiers: the conditional min-entropy, the
conditional von Neumann entropy and the conditional max-entropy. For the first,
we solve the min-max problem of finding the projective measurement that
minimises the maximal guessing probability of an eavesdropper. The result is
that one can guarantee an amount of conditional min-entropy
$H^*_{\textrm{min}}=-\log_2 P_{\textrm{guess}}^{*}(\rho)$ with
$P_{\textrm{guess}}^{*}(\rho)=\frac{1}{d}(\textrm{tr} \sqrt{\rho})^2$ by
performing suitable projective measurements. For the conditional von Neumann
entropy, we find that the maximal value is $H^{*}= \log_{2}d-S(\rho)$, with
$S(\rho)$ the von Neumann entropy of $\rho$, while for the conditional
max-entropy, we find the maximal value $H^{*}_\textrm{max}=\log_{2}d +
\log_{2}\lambda_{\textrm{max}}(\rho)$, where $\lambda_{\textrm{max}}(\rho)$ is
the largest eigenvalue of $\rho$. Optimal values for $H^{*}_{\textrm{min}}$,
$H^{*}$ and $H^{*}_\textrm{max}$ are achieved by measuring in any basis that is
unbiased to the eigenbasis of $\rho$, as well as by other, less intuitive,
measurements.

**PDF Url**: [2407.08682v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08682v1)

**Abstract**: In this study, we introduce the More-Interaction Particle Transformer
(MIParT), a novel deep learning neural network designed for jet tagging. This
framework incorporates our own design, the More-Interaction Attention (MIA)
mechanism, which increases the dimensionality of particle interaction
embeddings. We tested MIParT using the top tagging and quark-gluon datasets.
Our results show that MIParT not only matches the accuracy and AUC of
LorentzNet but also significantly outperforms the ParT model in background
rejection. Specifically, it improves background rejection by approximately 25\%
at a 30\% signal efficiency on the top tagging dataset and by 3\% on the
quark-gluon dataset. Additionally, MIParT requires only 30% of the parameters
and 47% of the computational complexity needed by ParT, proving that high
performance can be achieved with reduced model complexity and without extensive
pretraining on large datasets. The results suggest that MIParT has the
potential to advance efficiency benchmarks for jet tagging and event
identification in particle physics.

**Abstract**: Nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) has proven to be an effective
control method, but it is expensive to compute. This work demonstrates the use
of hardware FPGA neural network controllers trained to imitate NMPC with
supervised learning. We use these Neural Controllers (NCs) implemented on
inexpensive embedded FPGA hardware for high frequency control on physical
cartpole and F1TENTH race car. Our results show that the NCs match the control
performance of the NMPCs in simulation and outperform it in reality, due to the
faster control rate that is afforded by the quick FPGA NC inference. We
demonstrate kHz control rates for a physical cartpole and offloading control to
the FPGA hardware on the F1TENTH car. Code and hardware implementation for this
paper are available at https:// github.com/SensorsINI/Neural-Control-Tools.

**PDF Url**: [2407.08673v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08673v1)

**Abstract**: Feebly Interacting Particles are a commonly considered extension to the
Standard Model of Particle Physics. In many theoretical frameworks these
particles can explain observed physical phenomena which are in tension with the
current model. \textsc{ALPiNIST} is a simplified Monte Carlo framework aimed at
evaluating past, present, and future, short and long baseline experiments for
their sensitivities to different models of Axion-Like Particles. We present the
extension of this framework to accommodate new classes of Feebly Interacting
Particles with emphasis on Heavy Neutral Leptons. This extension is especially
well motivated, solving multiple of the standing issues with the Standard Model
at the same time. The fundamental importance of inputs on the resulting
parameter sensitivity, and thus the need for a unified simulation set-up, is
highlighted.

**Abstract**: Topological field theories and holomorphic field theories naturally appear in
both mathematics and physics. However, there exist intriguing hybrid theories
that are topological in some directions and holomorphic in others, such as
twists of supersymmetric field theories or Costello's 4-dimensional
Chern-Simons theory. In this paper, we rigorously prove the ultraviolet (UV)
finiteness for such hybrid theories on flat space, and present two significant
vanishing results regarding anomalies.


## Diffusion
### Video Diffusion Alignment via Reward Gradients

**PDF Url**: [2407.08737v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08737v1)

**Abstract**: We have made significant progress towards building foundational video
diffusion models. As these models are trained using large-scale unsupervised
data, it has become crucial to adapt these models to specific downstream tasks.
Adapting these models via supervised fine-tuning requires collecting target
datasets of videos, which is challenging and tedious. In this work, we utilize
pre-trained reward models that are learned via preferences on top of powerful
vision discriminative models to adapt video diffusion models. These models
contain dense gradient information with respect to generated RGB pixels, which
is critical to efficient learning in complex search spaces, such as videos. We
show that backpropagating gradients from these reward models to a video
diffusion model can allow for compute and sample efficient alignment of the
video diffusion model. We show results across a variety of reward models and
video diffusion models, demonstrating that our approach can learn much more
efficiently in terms of reward queries and computation than prior gradient-free
approaches. Our code, model weights,and more visualization are available at

### SLEDGE: Synthesizing Driving Environments with Generative Models and Rule-Based Traffic
**Authors**: Kashyap Chitta, Daniel Dauner, Andreas Geiger

**Published Date**: 2024-03-26

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-11

**PDF Url**: [2403.17933v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2403.17933v2)

**Abstract**: SLEDGE is the first generative simulator for vehicle motion planning trained
on real-world driving logs. Its core component is a learned model that is able
to generate agent bounding boxes and lane graphs. The model's outputs serve as
an initial state for rule-based traffic simulation. The unique properties of
the entities to be generated for SLEDGE, such as their connectivity and
variable count per scene, render the naive application of most modern
generative models to this task non-trivial. Therefore, together with a
systematic study of existing lane graph representations, we introduce a novel
raster-to-vector autoencoder. It encodes agents and the lane graph into
distinct channels in a rasterized latent map. This facilitates both
lane-conditioned agent generation and combined generation of lanes and agents
with a Diffusion Transformer. Using generated entities in SLEDGE enables
greater control over the simulation, e.g. upsampling turns or increasing
traffic density. Further, SLEDGE can support 500m long routes, a capability not
found in existing data-driven simulators like nuPlan. It presents new
challenges for planning algorithms, evidenced by failure rates of over 40% for
PDM, the winner of the 2023 nuPlan challenge, when tested on hard routes and
dense traffic generated by our model. Compared to nuPlan, SLEDGE requires
500$\times$ less storage to set up (<4 GB), making it a more accessible option
and helping with democratizing future research in this field.


### CAD-Prompted Generative Models: A Pathway to Feasible and Novel Engineering Designs

**Abstract**: Text-to-image generative models have increasingly been used to assist
designers during concept generation in various creative domains, such as
graphic design, user interface design, and fashion design. However, their
applications in engineering design remain limited due to the models' challenges
in generating images of feasible designs concepts. To address this issue, this
paper introduces a method that improves the design feasibility by prompting the
generation with feasible CAD images. In this work, the usefulness of this
method is investigated through a case study with a bike design task using an
off-the-shelf text-to-image model, Stable Diffusion 2.1. A diverse set of bike
designs are produced in seven different generation settings with varying CAD
image prompting weights, and these designs are evaluated on their perceived
feasibility and novelty. Results demonstrate that the CAD image prompting
successfully helps text-to-image models like Stable Diffusion 2.1 create
visibly more feasible design images. While a general tradeoff is observed
between feasibility and novelty, when the prompting weight is kept low around
0.35, the design feasibility is significantly improved while its novelty
remains on par with those generated by text prompts alone. The insights from
this case study offer some guidelines for selecting the appropriate CAD image
prompting weight for different stages of the engineering design process. When
utilized effectively, our CAD image prompting method opens doors to a wider
range of applications of text-to-image models in engineering design.


### Controlling the Fidelity and Diversity of Deep Generative Models via Pseudo Density
**Authors**: Shuangqi Li, Chen Liu, Tong Zhang, Hieu Le, Sabine Süsstrunk, Mathieu Salzmann

**Published Date**: 2024-07-11

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-11

**PDF Url**: [2407.08659v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.08659v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce an approach to bias deep generative models, such as GANs and
diffusion models, towards generating data with either enhanced fidelity or
increased diversity. Our approach involves manipulating the distribution of
training and generated data through a novel metric for individual samples,
named pseudo density, which is based on the nearest-neighbor information from
real samples. Our approach offers three distinct techniques to adjust the
fidelity and diversity of deep generative models: 1) Per-sample perturbation,
enabling precise adjustments for individual samples towards either more common
or more unique characteristics; 2) Importance sampling during model inference
to enhance either fidelity or diversity in the generated data; 3) Fine-tuning
with importance sampling, which guides the generative model to learn an
adjusted distribution, thus controlling fidelity and diversity. Furthermore,
our fine-tuning method demonstrates the ability to improve the Frechet
Inception Distance (FID) for pre-trained generative models with minimal
iterations.


### MOFA-Video: Controllable Image Animation via Generative Motion Field Adaptions in Frozen Image-to-Video Diffusion Model
**Authors**: Muyao Niu, Xiaodong Cun, Xintao Wang, Yong Zhang, Ying Shan, Yinqiang Zheng

**Published Date**: 2024-05-30

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-11

**PDF Url**: [2405.20222v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.20222v3)

**Abstract**: We present MOFA-Video, an advanced controllable image animation method that
generates video from the given image using various additional controllable
signals (such as human landmarks reference, manual trajectories, and another
even provided video) or their combinations. This is different from previous
methods which only can work on a specific motion domain or show weak control
abilities with diffusion prior. To achieve our goal, we design several
domain-aware motion field adapters (\ie, MOFA-Adapters) to control the
generated motions in the video generation pipeline. For MOFA-Adapters, we
consider the temporal motion consistency of the video and generate the dense
motion flow from the given sparse control conditions first, and then, the
multi-scale features of the given image are wrapped as a guided feature for
stable video diffusion generation. We naively train two motion adapters for the
manual trajectories and the human landmarks individually since they both
contain sparse information about the control. After training, the MOFA-Adapters
in different domains can also work together for more controllable video
generation. Project Page: https://myniuuu.github.io/MOFA_Video/
