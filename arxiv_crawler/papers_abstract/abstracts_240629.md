**Abstract**: We introduce a large class of models exhibiting robust ergodicity breaking in
quantum dynamics. Our work is inspired by recent discussions of "topologically
robust Hilbert space fragmentation," but massively generalizes in two
directions: firstly from states describable as "loop-soups" to a broader class
of states reminiscent of string-nets and sponges, and secondly from models
restricted to square or cubic lattices, to models defined on arbitrary lattices
(and even arbitrary graphs without translation invariance). Our constructions
leverage a recently proposed group-theory framework [PRX 14, 021034 (2024)],
and identify a host of new phenomena arising from the interplay of "group-model
dynamics" and lattice structure. We make crisp connections to gauge theories,
and our construction generalizes Kitaev's quantum double to infinite groups.

**Abstract**: Depending on the coupling to the environment, symmetries of open quantum
systems manifest in two distinct forms, the strong and the weak. We study the
spontaneous symmetry breaking among phases with different symmetries. Concrete
Liouvillian models with strong and weak symmetry are constructed, and different
scenarios of symmetry-breaking transitions are investigated from complementary
approaches. It is demonstrated that strong symmetry always spontaneously breaks
into the corresponding weak symmetry. For strong $U(1)$ symmetry, we show that
strong-to-weak symmetry breaking leads to gapless Goldstone modes dictating
diffusion of the symmetry charge in translational invariant systems. We
conjecture that this relation among strong-to-weak symmetry breaking, gapless
modes, and symmetry-charge diffusion is general for continuous symmetries. It
can be interpreted as an "enhanced Lieb-Schultz-Mattis (LSM) theorem" for open
quantum systems, according to which the gapless spectrum does not require
non-integer filling. We also investigate the scenario where the strong symmetry
breaks completely. In the symmetry-broken phase, we identify an effective
Keldysh action with two Goldstone modes, describing fluctuations of the order
parameter and diffusive hydrodynamics of the symmetry charge, respectively. For
a particular model studied here, we uncover a transition from a symmetric phase
with a "Bose surface" to a symmetry-broken phase with long-range order induced
by tuning the filling. It is also shown that the long-range order of $U(1)$
symmetry breaking is possible in spatial dimension $d\geq 3$, in both weak and
strong symmetry cases. Our work outline the typical scenarios of spontaneous
symmetry breaking in open quantum systems, and highlights their physical
consequences.


### Inflation, the Hubble Tension and Early Dark Energy: an alternative overview
**Authors**: William Giarè

**PDF Url**: [2404.12779v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.12779v2)

**Abstract**: I review and discuss the possible implications for inflation resulting from
considering new physics in light of the Hubble tension. My study is motivated
by a simple argument that the constraints on inflationary parameters, most
typically the spectral index $n_s$, depend to some extent on the cosmological
framework. To avoid broadening the uncertainties resulting from marginalizing
over additional parameters (typical in many alternative models), I first adopt
the same alternative viewpoint of previous studies and analyze what happens if
a physical theory can fix extra parameters to non-standard values. Focusing on
the dark energy equation of state $w$ and the effective number of relativistic
species $N_{\rm{eff}}$, I confirm that physical theories able to fix $w \approx
-1.2$ or $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.9$ produce values of $H_0$ from CMB and BAO in
line with the local distance ladder estimate. While in the former case I do not
find any relevant implications for inflation, in the latter scenarios, I
observe a shift towards $n_s \approx 1$. From a model-selection perspective,
both cases are strongly disfavored compared to $\Lambda$CDM. However, models
with $N_{\rm{eff}} \approx 3.3 - 3.4$ could bring the $H_0$ tension down to
$\sim 3\sigma$ while being moderately disfavored. Yet, this is enough to change
the constraints on inflation so that the most accredited models (e.g.,
Starobinsky inflation) would no longer be favored by data. I then focus on
Early Dark Energy (EDE), arguing that an EDE fraction $f_{\rm{EDE}}\sim 0.04 -
0.06$ (only able to mildly reduce the $H_0$-tension down to $\sim 3\sigma$)
could already require a similar change in perspective on inflation. In fact,
performing a full joint analysis of EDE and Starobinsky inflation, I find that
the two models can hardly coexist for $f_{\rm{EDE}}\gtrsim 0.06$.

**Abstract**: Intraventricular vector flow mapping (iVFM) seeks to enhance and quantify
color Doppler in cardiac imaging. In this study, we propose novel alternatives
to the traditional iVFM optimization scheme by utilizing physics-informed
neural networks (PINNs) and a physics-guided nnU-Net-based supervised approach.
When evaluated on simulated color Doppler images derived from a
patient-specific computational fluid dynamics model and in vivo Doppler
acquisitions, both approaches demonstrate comparable reconstruction performance
to the original iVFM algorithm. The efficiency of PINNs is boosted through
dual-stage optimization and pre-optimized weights. On the other hand, the
nnU-Net method excels in generalizability and real-time capabilities. Notably,
nnU-Net shows superior robustness on sparse and truncated Doppler data while
maintaining independence from explicit boundary conditions. Overall, our
results highlight the effectiveness of these methods in reconstructing
intraventricular vector blood flow. The study also suggests potential
applications of PINNs in ultrafast color Doppler imaging and the incorporation
of fluid dynamics equations to derive biomarkers for cardiovascular diseases
based on blood flow.

**Abstract**: This study introduces a hybrid fluid simulation approach that integrates
generative diffusion models with physics-based simulations, aiming at reducing
the computational costs of flow simulations while still honoring all the
physical properties of interest. These simulations enhance our understanding of
applications such as assessing hydrogen and CO$_2$ storage efficiency in
underground reservoirs. Nevertheless, they are computationally expensive and
the presence of nonunique solutions can require multiple simulations within a
single geometry. To overcome the computational cost hurdle, we propose a hybrid
method that couples generative diffusion models and physics-based modeling. We
introduce a system to condition the diffusion model with a geometry of
interest, allowing to produce variable fluid saturations in the same geometry.
While training the model, we simultaneously generate initial conditions and
perform physics-based simulations using these conditions. This integrated
approach enables us to receive real-time feedback on a single compute node
equipped with both CPUs and GPUs. By efficiently managing these processes
within one compute node, we can continuously evaluate performance and stop
training when the desired criteria are met. To test our model, we generate
realizations in a real Berea sandstone fracture which shows that our technique
is up to 4.4 times faster than commonly used flow simulation initializations.


### Error-corrected Hadamard gate simulated at the circuit level

**PDF Url**: [2312.11605v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.11605v2)

**Abstract**: We simulate the logical Hadamard gate in the surface code under a
circuit-level noise model, compiling it to a physical circuit on square-grid
connectivity hardware. Our paper is the first to do this for a logical unitary
gate on a quantum error-correction code. We consider two proposals, both via
patch-deformation: one that applies a transversal Hadamard gate (i.e. a domain
wall through time) to interchange the logical $X$ and $Z$ strings, and another
that applies a domain wall through space to achieve this interchange. We
explain in detail why they perform the logical Hadamard gate by tracking how
the stabilisers and the logical operators are transformed in each quantum
error-correction round. We optimise the physical circuits and evaluate their
logical failure probabilities, which we find to be comparable to those of a
quantum memory experiment for the same number of quantum error-correction
rounds. We present syndrome-extraction circuits that maintain the same
effective distance under circuit-level noise as under phenomenological noise.
We also explain how a $SWAP$-quantum error-correction round (required to return
the patch to its initial position) can be compiled to only four two-qubit gate
layers. This can be applied to more general scenarios and, as a byproduct,
explains from first principles how the "stepping" circuits of the recent Google
paper [McEwen, Bacon, and Gidney, Quantum 7, 1172 (2023)] can be constructed.


### Nonuniqueness in Defining the Polarization: Nonlocal Surface Charges and the Electrostatic, Energetic, and Transport Perspectives

**Abstract**: Ionic crystals play a central role in functional applications. Mesoscale
descriptions of these crystals are based on the continuum polarization density
field to represent the effective physics of charge distribution at the scale of
the atomic lattice. However, a long-standing difficulty is that the classical
electrostatic definition of the macroscopic polarization -- as the dipole or
first moment of the charge density in a unit cell -- is not unique. This
unphysical non-uniqueness has been shown to arise from starting directly with
an infinite system rather than starting with a finite body and taking
appropriate limits. This limit process shows that the electrostatic description
requires not only the bulk polarization density, but also the surface charge
density, as the effective macroscopic descriptors; that is, a nonlocal
effective description. Other approaches to resolve this difficulty include
relating the change in polarization to the transport of charge; or, to define
the polarization as the energy-conjugate to the electric field.
  This work examines the relation between the classical electrostatic
definition of polarization, and the transport and energy-conjugate definitions
of polarization. We show the following: (1) The transport of charge does not
correspond to the change in polarization in general; instead, one requires
additional simplifying assumptions on the electrostatic definition of
polarization for these approaches to give rise to the same macroscopic electric
fields. Thus, the electrostatic definition encompasses the transport definition
as a special case. (2) The energy-conjugate definition has both bulk and
surface contributions; while traditional approaches neglect the surface
contribution, we find that accounting for the nonlocal surface contributions is
essential to obtain the correct macroscopic electric fields.


### Probing self-interacting ultra-high-energy neutrinos with cosmic 21-cm signal

**PDF Url**: [2406.19279v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19279v1)

**Abstract**: In this study, we investigate the constraints on secret self-interactions of
neutrinos by examining the impact of radiative scattering of ultra-high-energy
(UHE) neutrinos. These neutrinos are produced from the decay of superheavy dark
matter and interact with the cosmic neutrino background (C$\nu$B). We explore
how these interactions influence the 21-cm hydrogen signal during the cosmic
dark ages and cosmic dawn, periods relatively free from astrophysical
uncertainties, providing a clearer signal for studying non-standard neutrino
interactions. By analyzing the global brightness temperature measurements, we
constrain the scattering cross-section of UHE self-interacting neutrinos,
determining the coupling constant $g$ to be within $\sim 10^{-4}$ to $\sim
10^{-3}$ for neutrino energies in the PeV to EeV range. Interestingly, these
constraints are more competitive than those from existing astrophysical and
collider experiments. As future 21-cm experiments focus on measuring brightness
temperature across a wide range of redshifts from the cosmic dark ages to
reionization, using the epoch of 21-cm to probe neutrino properties could
provide crucial insights into dark matter and neutrino physics.


### Fractal Subsystem Symmetries, Anomalies, Boundaries, and Effective Field Theory

**Abstract**: This work reports an extensive study of three-dimensional topological ordered
phases that, in one of the directions behave like usual topological order
concerning mobility of excitations, but in the perpendicular plane manifest
type-II fracton physics dictated by a fractal subsystem symmetry. We obtain an
expression for the ground state degeneracy, which depends intricately on the
sizes of the plane, signaling a strong manifestation of ultraviolet/infrared
(UV/IR) mixing. The ground state degeneracy can be interpreted in terms of
spontaneous/explicit breaking of fractal subsystem symmetries. We also study
the boundary physics, which in turn is useful to understand the connection with
certain two-dimensional phases. Finally, we derive a low-energy but not
long-distance effective field theory, by Higgsing a fractal $U(1)$ symmetry and
taking the deep IR limit. This description embodies in a natural way several
aspects of the phases, such as the content of generalized global symmetries,
the role of fractal symmetries on the mobility of excitations, the anomalies,
and the boundary physics.


### Asymptotic stability of the equilibrium for the free boundary problem of a compressible atmospheric primitive model with physical vacuum

**PDF Url**: [2406.19259v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19259v1)

**Abstract**: This paper concerns the large time asymptotic behavior of solutions to the
free boundary problem of the compressible primitive equations in atmospheric
dynamics with physical vacuum. Up to second order of the perturbations of an
equilibrium, we have introduced a model of the compressible primitive equations
with a specific viscosity and shown that the physical vacuum free boundary
problem for this model system has a global-in-time solution converging to an
equilibrium exponentially, provided that the initial data is a small
perturbation of the equilibrium. More precisely, we introduce a new coordinate
system by choosing the enthalpy (the square of sound speed) as the vertical
coordinate, and thanks to the hydrostatic balance, the degenerate density at
the free boundary admits a representation with separation of variables in the
new coordinates. Such a property allows us to establish horizontal derivative
estimates without involving the singular vertical derivative of the density
profile, which plays a key role in our analysis.

**PDF Url**: [2406.19328v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2406.19328v1)

**Abstract**: We present Subtractive Training, a simple and novel method for synthesizing
individual musical instrument stems given other instruments as context. This
method pairs a dataset of complete music mixes with 1) a variant of the dataset
lacking a specific stem, and 2) LLM-generated instructions describing how the
missing stem should be reintroduced. We then fine-tune a pretrained
text-to-audio diffusion model to generate the missing instrument stem, guided
by both the existing stems and the text instruction. Our results demonstrate
Subtractive Training's efficacy in creating authentic drum stems that
seamlessly blend with the existing tracks. We also show that we can use the
text instruction to control the generation of the inserted stem in terms of
rhythm, dynamics, and genre, allowing us to modify the style of a single
instrument in a full song while keeping the remaining instruments the same.
Lastly, we extend this technique to MIDI formats, successfully generating
compatible bass, drum, and guitar parts for incomplete arrangements.


### $μ$GUIDE: a framework for quantitative imaging via generalized uncertainty-driven inference using deep learning
**Authors**: Maëliss Jallais, Marco Palombo

**Published Date**: 2023-12-28

**Updated Date**: 2024-06-27

**PDF Url**: [2312.17293v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2312.17293v3)

**Abstract**: This work proposes $\mu$GUIDE: a general Bayesian framework to estimate
posterior distributions of tissue microstructure parameters from any given
biophysical model or MRI signal representation, with exemplar demonstration in
diffusion-weighted MRI. Harnessing a new deep learning architecture for
automatic signal feature selection combined with simulation-based inference and
efficient sampling of the posterior distributions, $\mu$GUIDE bypasses the high
computational and time cost of conventional Bayesian approaches and does not
rely on acquisition constraints to define model-specific summary statistics.
The obtained posterior distributions allow to highlight degeneracies present in
the model definition and quantify the uncertainty and ambiguity of the
estimated parameters.


### Compositional Image Decomposition with Diffusion Models

**Abstract**: Given an image of a natural scene, we are able to quickly decompose it into a
set of components such as objects, lighting, shadows, and foreground. We can
then envision a scene where we combine certain components with those from other
images, for instance a set of objects from our bedroom and animals from a zoo
under the lighting conditions of a forest, even if we have never encountered
such a scene before. In this paper, we present a method to decompose an image
into such compositional components. Our approach, Decomp Diffusion, is an
unsupervised method which, when given a single image, infers a set of different
components in the image, each represented by a diffusion model. We demonstrate
how components can capture different factors of the scene, ranging from global
scene descriptors like shadows or facial expression to local scene descriptors
like constituent objects. We further illustrate how inferred factors can be
flexibly composed, even with factors inferred from other models, to generate a
variety of scenes sharply different than those seen in training time. Website

### DEX-TTS: Diffusion-based EXpressive Text-to-Speech with Style Modeling on Time Variability
**Authors**: Hyun Joon Park, Jin Sob Kim, Wooseok Shin, Sung Won Han

**Abstract**: Expressive Text-to-Speech (TTS) using reference speech has been studied
extensively to synthesize natural speech, but there are limitations to
obtaining well-represented styles and improving model generalization ability.
In this study, we present Diffusion-based EXpressive TTS (DEX-TTS), an acoustic
model designed for reference-based speech synthesis with enhanced style
representations. Based on a general diffusion TTS framework, DEX-TTS includes
encoders and adapters to handle styles extracted from reference speech. Key
innovations contain the differentiation of styles into time-invariant and
time-variant categories for effective style extraction, as well as the design
of encoders and adapters with high generalization ability. In addition, we
introduce overlapping patchify and convolution-frequency patch embedding
strategies to improve DiT-based diffusion networks for TTS. DEX-TTS yields
outstanding performance in terms of objective and subjective evaluation in
English multi-speaker and emotional multi-speaker datasets, without relying on
pre-training strategies. Lastly, the comparison results for the general TTS on
a single-speaker dataset verify the effectiveness of our enhanced diffusion
backbone. Demos are available here.
