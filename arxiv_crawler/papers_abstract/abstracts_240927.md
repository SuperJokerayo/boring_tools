**Abstract**: Understanding the physics of the two-dimensional Hubbard model is widely
believed to be a key step in achieving a full understanding of
high-$T_\mathrm{c}$ cuprate superconductors. In recent years, progress has been
made by large-scale numerical simulations at finite doping and, on the other
hand, by microscopic theories able to capture the physics of individual charge
carriers. In this work, we study single pairs of dopants in a cylindrical
system using the density-matrix renormalization group algorithm. We identify
two coexisting charge configurations that couple to the spin environment in
different ways: A tightly bound configuration featuring (next-)nearest-neighbor
pairs and a stripe-like configuration of dopants on opposite sides of the
cylinder, accompanied by a spin domain wall. Thus, we establish that the
interplay between stripe order and uniform pairing, central to the models'
phases at finite doping, has its origin at the single-pair level. By
interpolating between the Hubbard and the related $t$-$J$ model, we are able to
quantitatively understand discrepancies in the pairing properties of the two
models through the three-site hopping term usually omitted from the $t$-$J$
Hamiltonian. This term is closely related to a next-nearest-neighbor tunneling
$t'$, which we observe to upset the balance between the competing stripe and
pair states on the two-dopant level.


### Intruding the sealed land: Unique forbidden beta decays at zero momentum transfer

**PDF Url**: [2409.18115v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18115v1)

**Abstract**: We report the first study of the $\mathcal{O}(\alpha)$ structure-dependent
electromagnetic radiative corrections to unique first-forbidden nuclear beta
decays. We show that the insertion of angular momentum into the nuclear matrix
element by the virtual/real photon exchange opens up the decay at vanishing
nuclear recoil momentum which was forbidden at tree level, leading to a
dramatic change in the decay spectrum not anticipated in existing studies. We
discuss its implications for precision tests on the Standard Model and searches
for new physics.

**Abstract**: Artificial neural networks often struggle with catastrophic forgetting when
learning multiple tasks sequentially, as training on new tasks degrades the
performance on previously learned ones. Recent theoretical work has addressed
this issue by analysing learning curves in synthetic frameworks under
predefined training protocols. However, these protocols relied on heuristics
and lacked a solid theoretical foundation assessing their optimality. In this
paper, we fill this gap combining exact equations for training dynamics,
derived using statistical physics techniques, with optimal control methods. We
apply this approach to teacher-student models for continual learning and
multi-task problems, obtaining a theory for task-selection protocols maximising
performance while minimising forgetting. Our theoretical analysis offers
non-trivial yet interpretable strategies for mitigating catastrophic
forgetting, shedding light on how optimal learning protocols can modulate
established effects, such as the influence of task similarity on forgetting.
Finally, we validate our theoretical findings on real-world data.


### Efficacy of a hybrid take home and in class summative assessment for the postsecondary physics classroom
**Authors**: Paul Stonaha, Stephanie Douglas

**PDF Url**: [2409.18058v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18058v1)

**Abstract**: Assigning course grades to students requires obtaining accurate measures of
the students' understanding and knowledge of the topic. The induced stress from
a traditional summative assessment is known to negatively impact student
grades, confounding the connection between knowledge and test grades.
Documented approaches to reduce stress during examinations can lead to a
distracting testing environment (two-stage tests) or are subject to cheating
(take-home tests). We have developed a hybrid take-home/in-class exam that
avoids such difficulties. We present herein the responses from student surveys
conducted after each exam. The results of the surveys indicate that the hybrid
exam method reduces test anxiety while improving students' self-reported
mastery of physics, as compared to traditional in-class summative assessments.
These findings are significant at the p < 0.05 level. Lastly, we discuss the
difficulties encountered in applying this test approach.


### Mixmasters in Wonderland: Chaotic dynamics from Carroll limits of gravity
**Authors**: Gerben Oling, Juan F. Pedraza

**Published Date**: 2024-09-09

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-26

**PDF Url**: [2409.05836v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.05836v2)

**Abstract**: We demonstrate that the Carroll limit of general relativity coupled to matter
captures the chaotic mixmaster dynamics of near-singularity limits. Zooming in
on the behavior of general relativity close to spacelike singularities reveals
rich and solvable ultra-local Belinski-Khalatnikov-Lifshitz (BKL) dynamics,
which we show to be captured by a Carroll limit. Specifically, building on
recent work on geometric Carroll expansions of general relativity, we establish
that leading-order Carroll gravity, with suitable matter coupling, accurately
describes well-known cosmological billiards behavior. Since the Carroll limit
implements the ultra-local limit off shell, this opens up the door to a wide
range of possible tractable applications, including spatially inhomogeneous
setups and the emergence of spikes at late times. This further suggests that
Carroll gravity, along with its subleading corrections, could serve as a
valuable tool for studying deep infrared physics in AdS/CFT.

**Abstract**: Simulating fluid flow around arbitrary shapes is key to solving various
engineering problems. However, simulating flow physics across complex
geometries remains numerically challenging and computationally
resource-intensive, particularly when using conventional PDE solvers. Machine
learning methods offer attractive opportunities to create fast and adaptable
PDE solvers. However, benchmark datasets to measure the performance of such
methods are scarce, especially for flow physics across complex geometries. We
introduce FlowBench, a dataset for neural simulators with over 10K samples,
which is currently larger than any publicly available flow physics dataset.
FlowBench contains flow simulation data across complex geometries
(\textit{parametric vs. non-parametric}), spanning a range of flow conditions
(\textit{Reynolds number and Grashoff number}), capturing a diverse array of
flow phenomena (\textit{steady vs. transient; forced vs. free convection}), and
for both 2D and 3D. FlowBench contains over 10K data samples, with each sample
the outcome of a fully resolved, direct numerical simulation using a
well-validated simulator framework designed for modeling transport phenomena in
complex geometries. For each sample, we include velocity, pressure, and
temperature field data at 3 different resolutions and several summary
statistics features of engineering relevance (such as coefficients of lift and
drag, and Nusselt numbers). %Additionally, we include masks and signed distance
fields for each shape. We envision that FlowBench will enable evaluating the
interplay between complex geometry, coupled flow phenomena, and data
sufficiency on the performance of current, and future, neural PDE solvers. We
enumerate several evaluation metrics to help rank order the performance of
neural PDE solvers. We benchmark the performance of several baseline methods
including FNO, CNO, WNO, and DeepONet.

**Abstract**: Molecular Dynamics (MD) is crucial in various fields such as materials
science, chemistry, and pharmacology to name a few. Conventional MD software
struggles with the balance between time cost and prediction accuracy, which
restricts its wider application. Recently, data-driven approaches based on deep
generative models have been devised for time-coarsened dynamics, which aim at
learning dynamics of diverse molecular systems over a long timestep, enjoying
both universality and efficiency. Nevertheless, most current methods are
designed solely to learn from the data distribution regardless of the
underlying Boltzmann distribution, and the physics priors such as energies and
forces are constantly overlooked. In this work, we propose a conditional
generative model called Force-guided Bridge Matching (FBM), which learns
full-atom time-coarsened dynamics and targets the Boltzmann-constrained
distribution. With the guidance of our delicately-designed intermediate force
field, FBM leverages favourable physics priors into the generation process,
giving rise to enhanced simulations. Experiments on two datasets consisting of
peptides verify our superiority in terms of comprehensive metrics and
demonstrate transferability to unseen systems.

**Abstract**: We present a detailed characterization of the structure and evolution of
differentially rotating plasmas driven on the MAGPIE pulsed-power generator
(1.4 MA peak current, 240 ns rise-time). The experiments were designed to
simulate physics relevant to accretion discs and jets on laboratory scales. A
cylindrical aluminium wire array Z pinch enclosed by return posts with an
overall azimuthal off-set angle was driven to produce ablation plasma flows
that propagate inwards in a slightly off-radial trajectory, injecting mass,
angular momentum, and confining ram pressure to a rotating plasma column on the
axis. However, the plasma is free to expand axially, forming a collimated,
differentially rotating axial jet that propagates at $\approx 100$ km/s. The
density profile of the jet corresponds to a dense shell surrounding a
low-density core, which is consistent with the centrifugal barrier effect being
sustained along the jet's propagation. We show analytically that, as the
rotating plasma accretes mass, conservation of mass and momentum implies plasma
radial growth scaling as $r \propto t^{1/3}$. As the characteristic moment of
inertia increases, the rotation velocity is predicted to decrease and settle on
a characteristic value $\approx 20$ km/s. We find that both predictions are in
agreement with Thomson scattering and optical self-emission imaging
measurements.


### Spatiotemporal Learning on Cell-embedded Graphs
**Authors**: Yuan Mi, Hao Sun

**Abstract**: Data-driven simulation of physical systems has recently kindled significant
attention, where many neural models have been developed. In particular,
mesh-based graph neural networks (GNNs) have demonstrated significant potential
in predicting spatiotemporal dynamics across arbitrary geometric domains.
However, the existing node-edge message passing mechanism in GNNs limits the
model's representation learning ability. In this paper, we proposed a
cell-embedded GNN model (aka CeGNN) to learn spatiotemporal dynamics with
lifted performance. Specifically, we introduce a learnable cell attribution to
the node-edge message passing process, which better captures the spatial
dependency of regional features. Such a strategy essentially upgrades the local
aggregation scheme from the first order (e.g., from edge to node) to a higher
order (e.g., from volume to edge and then to node), which takes advantage of
volumetric information in message passing. Meanwhile, a novel feature-enhanced
block is designed to further improve the performance of CeGNN and relieve the
over-smoothness problem, via treating the latent features as basis functions.
The extensive experiments on various PDE systems and one real-world dataset
demonstrate that CeGNN achieves superior performance compared with other
baseline models, particularly reducing the prediction error with up to 1 orders
of magnitude on several PDE systems.


### A neural network study of the phase transitions of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state Potts models on the square lattice
**Authors**: Yuan-Heng Tseng, Fu-Jiun Jiang

**PDF Url**: [2409.17984v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17984v1)

**Abstract**: The critical phenomena of the two-dimensional antiferromagnetic $q$-state
Potts model on the square lattice with $q=2,3,4$ are investigated using the
techniques of neural networks (NN). In particular, an unconventional supervised
NN which is trained using no information about the physics of the considered
systems is employed. In addition, conventional unsupervised autoencoders (AECs)
are used in our study as well. Remarkably, while the conventional AECs fail to
uncover the critical phenomena of the systems investigated here, our
unconventional supervised NN correctly identifies the critical behaviors of all
three considered antiferromagnetic $q$-state models. The results obtained in
this study suggest convincingly that the applicability of our unconventional
supervised NN is broader than one anticipates. In particular, when a new system
is studied with our NN, it is likely that it is not necessary to conduct any
training, and one only needs to examine whether an appropriate reduced
representation of the original raw configurations exists, so that the same
already trained NN can be employed to explore the related phase transition
efficiently.


## Diffusion
### DiffSSC: Semantic LiDAR Scan Completion using Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Models
**Authors**: Helin Cao, Sven Behnke

**Published Date**: 2024-09-26

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-26

**PDF Url**: [2409.18092v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.18092v1)

**Abstract**: Perception systems play a crucial role in autonomous driving, incorporating
multiple sensors and corresponding computer vision algorithms. 3D LiDAR sensors
are widely used to capture sparse point clouds of the vehicle's surroundings.
However, such systems struggle to perceive occluded areas and gaps in the scene
due to the sparsity of these point clouds and their lack of semantics. To
address these challenges, Semantic Scene Completion (SSC) jointly predicts
unobserved geometry and semantics in the scene given raw LiDAR measurements,
aiming for a more complete scene representation. Building on promising results
of diffusion models in image generation and super-resolution tasks, we propose
their extension to SSC by implementing the noising and denoising diffusion
processes in the point and semantic spaces individually. To control the
generation, we employ semantic LiDAR point clouds as conditional input and
design local and global regularization losses to stabilize the denoising
process. We evaluate our approach on autonomous driving datasets and our
approach outperforms the state-of-the-art for SSC.


### PhoCoLens: Photorealistic and Consistent Reconstruction in Lensless Imaging
**Authors**: Xin Cai, Zhiyuan You, Hailong Zhang, Wentao Liu, Jinwei Gu, Tianfan Xue

**Published Date**: 2024-09-26

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-26

**PDF Url**: [2409.17996v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17996v1)

**Abstract**: Lensless cameras offer significant advantages in size, weight, and cost
compared to traditional lens-based systems. Without a focusing lens, lensless
cameras rely on computational algorithms to recover the scenes from multiplexed
measurements. However, current algorithms struggle with inaccurate forward
imaging models and insufficient priors to reconstruct high-quality images. To
overcome these limitations, we introduce a novel two-stage approach for
consistent and photorealistic lensless image reconstruction. The first stage of
our approach ensures data consistency by focusing on accurately reconstructing
the low-frequency content with a spatially varying deconvolution method that
adjusts to changes in the Point Spread Function (PSF) across the camera's field
of view. The second stage enhances photorealism by incorporating a generative
prior from pre-trained diffusion models. By conditioning on the low-frequency
content retrieved in the first stage, the diffusion model effectively
reconstructs the high-frequency details that are typically lost in the lensless
imaging process, while also maintaining image fidelity. Our method achieves a
superior balance between data fidelity and visual quality compared to existing
methods, as demonstrated with two popular lensless systems, PhlatCam and
DiffuserCam. Project website: https://phocolens.github.io/.


### Joint Localization and Planning using Diffusion

**PDF Url**: [2409.17995v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.17995v1)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have been successfully applied to robotics problems such as
manipulation and vehicle path planning. In this work, we explore their
application to end-to-end navigation -- including both perception and planning
-- by considering the problem of jointly performing global localization and
path planning in known but arbitrary 2D environments. In particular, we
introduce a diffusion model which produces collision-free paths in a global
reference frame given an egocentric LIDAR scan, an arbitrary map, and a desired
goal position. To this end, we implement diffusion in the space of paths in
SE(2), and describe how to condition the denoising process on both obstacles
and sensor observations. In our evaluation, we show that the proposed
conditioning techniques enable generalization to realistic maps of considerably
different appearance than the training environment, demonstrate our model's
ability to accurately describe ambiguous solutions, and run extensive
simulation experiments showcasing our model's use as a real-time, end-to-end
localization and planning stack.


### Transport meets Variational Inference: Controlled Monte Carlo Diffusions

**Updated Date**: 2024-09-26

**PDF Url**: [2307.01050v10](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2307.01050v10)

**Abstract**: Connecting optimal transport and variational inference, we present a
principled and systematic framework for sampling and generative modelling
centred around divergences on path space. Our work culminates in the
development of the \emph{Controlled Monte Carlo Diffusion} sampler (CMCD) for
Bayesian computation, a score-based annealing technique that crucially adapts
both forward and backward dynamics in a diffusion model. On the way, we clarify
the relationship between the EM-algorithm and iterative proportional fitting
(IPF) for Schr{\"o}dinger bridges, deriving as well a regularised objective
that bypasses the iterative bottleneck of standard IPF-updates. Finally, we
show that CMCD has a strong foundation in the Jarzinsky and Crooks identities
from statistical physics, and that it convincingly outperforms competing
approaches across a wide array of experiments.


### Pioneering Reliable Assessment in Text-to-Image Knowledge Editing: Leveraging a Fine-Grained Dataset and an Innovative Criterion

**Abstract**: During pre-training, the Text-to-Image (T2I) diffusion models encode factual
knowledge into their parameters. These parameterized facts enable realistic
image generation, but they may become obsolete over time, thereby
misrepresenting the current state of the world. Knowledge editing techniques
aim to update model knowledge in a targeted way. However, facing the dual
challenges posed by inadequate editing datasets and unreliable evaluation
criterion, the development of T2I knowledge editing encounter difficulties in
effectively generalizing injected knowledge. In this work, we design a T2I
knowledge editing framework by comprehensively spanning on three phases: First,
we curate a dataset \textbf{CAKE}, comprising paraphrase and multi-object test,
to enable more fine-grained assessment on knowledge generalization. Second, we
propose a novel criterion, \textbf{adaptive CLIP threshold}, to effectively
filter out false successful images under the current criterion and achieve
reliable editing evaluation. Finally, we introduce \textbf{MPE}, a simple but
effective approach for T2I knowledge editing. Instead of tuning parameters, MPE
precisely recognizes and edits the outdated part of the conditioning
text-prompt to accommodate the up-to-date knowledge. A straightforward
implementation of MPE (Based on in-context learning) exhibits better overall
performance than previous model editors. We hope these efforts can further
promote faithful evaluation of T2I knowledge editing methods.
