**Abstract**: Estimation of the Fisher Information Metric (FIM-estimation) is an important
task that arises in unsupervised learning of phase transitions, a problem
proposed by physicists. This work completes the definition of the task by
defining rigorous evaluation metrics distMSE, distMSEPS, and distRE and
introduces ClassiFIM, a novel machine learning method designed to solve the
FIM-estimation task. Unlike existing methods for unsupervised learning of phase
transitions, ClassiFIM directly estimates a well-defined quantity (the FIM),
allowing it to be rigorously compared to any present and future other methods
that estimate the same. ClassiFIM transforms a dataset for the FIM-estimation
task into a dataset for an auxiliary binary classification task and involves
selecting and training a model for the latter. We prove that the output of
ClassiFIM approaches the exact FIM in the limit of infinite dataset size and
under certain regularity conditions. We implement ClassiFIM on multiple
datasets, including datasets describing classical and quantum phase
transitions, and find that it achieves a good ground truth approximation with
modest computational resources. Furthermore, we independently implement two
alternative state-of-the-art methods for unsupervised estimation of phase
transition locations on the same datasets and find that ClassiFIM predicts such
locations at least as well as these other methods. To emphasize the generality
of our method, we also propose and generate the MNIST-CNN dataset, which
consists of the output of CNNs trained on MNIST for different hyperparameter
choices. Using ClassiFIM on this dataset suggests there is a phase transition
in the distribution of image-prediction pairs for CNNs trained on MNIST,
demonstrating the broad scope of FIM-estimation beyond physics.

**Abstract**: Optomechanics, the study of the mechanical interaction of light with matter,
has proven to be a fruitful area of research that has yielded many notable
achievements, including the direct detection of gravitational waves in
kilometer-scale optical interferometers. Light has been used to cool and
demonstrate quantum control over the mechanical degrees of freedom of
individual ions and atoms, and more recently has facilitated the observation of
quantum ``mechanics'' in objects of larger mass, even at the kg-scale. Optical
levitation, where an object can be suspended by radiation pressure and largely
decoupled from its environment, has recently established itself as a rich field
of study, with many notable results relevant for precision measurement, quantum
information science, and foundational tests of quantum mechanics and
fundamental physics. This article provides a survey of several current
activities in field along with a tutorial describing associated key concepts
and methods, both from an experimental and theoretical approach. It is intended
as a resource for junior researchers who are new to this growing field as well
as beginning graduate students. The tutorial is concluded with a perspective on
both promising emerging experimental platforms and anticipated future
theoretical developments.


### Parametrization sampling and the pion PDF in a phenomenological analysis
**Authors**: Aurore Courtoy

**Published Date**: 2024-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2408.03318v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03318v1)

**Abstract**: In these proceedings, we extend the discussion of the pion PDF obtained by
NLO QCD analysis in the Fant\^omas4QCD framework. Our pion analysis uses a
state-of-the-art statistical methodology that accounts for the epistemic
uncertainty. Fant\^omas4QCD, designed to handle multiple functional forms for
solving the inverse problem, systematically explores a variety of solutions for
PDFs, thereby improving estimates of epistemic uncertainty. Through this novel
approach, we interpret our results for the valence sector, considering various
non-perturbative methods available for predicting the pion PDF. We emphasize
the distinctions between (global) QCD analyses and QFT-based calculations.


### A non-Hermitian quantum mechanics approach for extracting and emulating continuum physics based on bound-state-like calculations
**Authors**: Xilin Zhang

**Published Date**: 2024-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2408.03309v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03309v1)

**Abstract**: This work develops a new method for computing a finite quantum system's
continuum states and observables by applying a subspace projection (or reduced
basis) method used in model order reduction studies to ``discretize'' the
system's continuous spectrum. The method extracts the continuum physics from
solving Schr\"odinger equations with bound-state-like boundary conditions and
emulates this extraction in the space of the input parameters. This parameter
emulation can readily be adapted to emulate other continuum calculations as
well, e.g., those based on complex energy or Lorentz integral transform
methods. Here, I give an overview of the key aspects of the formalism and some
informative findings from numerical experimentation with two- and three-body
systems, which indicates the non-Hermitian quantum mechanics nature of the
method. A potential connection with (near-)optimal rational approximation
studied in Math literature is also discussed. Further details are provided in a
separate paper.


### Photonic Mpemba effect
**Authors**: Stefano Longhi

**Published Date**: 2024-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2408.03296v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03296v1)

**Abstract**: The Mpemba effect is the counterintuitive phenomenon in statistical physics
for which a far-from-equilibrium state can relax toward equilibrium faster than
a state closer to equilibrium. This effect has raised a great curiosity since
long time and has been studied extensively in many classical and quantum
systems. Here it is shown that the Mpemba effect can be observed in optics as
well. Specifically, the process of light diffusion in finite-sized photonic
lattices under incoherent (dephasing) dynamics is considered. Rather
surprisingly, it is shown that certain highly-localized initial light
distributions can diffuse faster than initial broadly delocalized
distributions. The effect is illustrated by considering random walk of optical
pulses in fiber-based temporal mesh lattices, which should provide an
experimentally-accessible setup for the demonstration of the Mpemba effect in
optics.

**Authors**: Lukasz A. Sterczewski, Jakub Mnich, Jaroslaw Sotor

**PDF Url**: [2407.20745v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.20745v2)

**Abstract**: Organic nonlinear optical (NLO) crystals have emerged as efficient
room-temperature emitters of broadband THz radiation with high electric field
strengths. Although initially confined to high-pulse-energy excitation in the
millijoule range with kHz rates, recent efforts have focused on tailoring the
physical properties of organic NLO materials for compatibility with popular
MHz-rate telecommunication wavelength lasers emitting nanojoule energy pulses.
This is motivated by the large potential of such crystals for more portable and
user-safe spectroscopic systems, additionally complemented by their
room-temperature field-sensitive THz detection capabilities. In this work, we
demonstrate the MHz-rate operation of the organic crystal PNPA
((E)-4-((4-nitrobenzylidene)amino)-$N$-phenylaniline), which was recently
discovered through data mining algorithms and reported to surpass the
conversion efficiency of rivaling NLO crystals at 1 kHz repetition rate. Using
a compact 200 mW Er:fiber laser producing 18 fs pulses at 50 MHz repetition
rate, we demonstrate the THz field generation and detection capabilities of
PNPA via performing gas phase spectroscopy in the 1.3-8.5 THz range. We obtain
a dynamic range of 40 dB over 3.6 s and 70 dB over 2 hours. Our work extends
the family of organic crystals compatible with telecommunication-wavelength
excitation using nJ pulses for spectroscopy beyond 5 THz.


### Kinetic scales dominated by magnetic helicity in space plasmas
**Authors**: A. Bershadskii

**Published Date**: 2024-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2408.03267v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03267v1)

**Abstract**: It is shown, using results of fully kinetic 3D numerical simulations and
observations in solar wind and Earth's magnetosphere that the transition from
deterministic chaos to turbulence at kinetic (sub-ion) scales in space plasmas
is generally dominated by magnetic helicity (an adiabatic invariant in a weakly
dissipative plasma) directly or through the Kolmogorov-Iroshnikov phenomenology
(the magneto-inertial range of scales as a precursor of hard turbulence).
Despite the considerable differences in the scales and physical parameters, the
results of numerical simulations are in quantitative agreement with the space
observations in the frames of this approach.


### Locally Scale Invariant Chern-Simons Actions in 3+1 Dimensions and Their Emergence From 4+2 Dimensional 2T-Physics
**Authors**: Itzhak Bars, Sophia D. Singh

**Published Date**: 2024-05-09

**PDF Url**: [2405.05510v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.05510v2)

**Abstract**: The traditional Chern-Simons (CS) terms in 3+1 dimensions that modify General
Relativity (GR), Quantum Chromodynamics (QCD), and Quantum Electrodynamics
(QED), typically lack scale invariance. However, a locally scale invariant and
geodesically complete framework for the Standard Model (SM) coupled to GR was
previously constructed by employing a tailored form of local scale (Weyl)
symmetry. This refined SM+GR model closely resembles the conventional SM in
subatomic realms where gravitational effects are negligible. Nevertheless, it
offers an intriguing prediction: the emergence of new physics beyond the
traditional SM and GR near spacetime singularities, characterized by intense
gravity and substantial deviations in the Higgs field. In this study, we expand
upon the enhanced SM+GR by incorporating Weyl invariant CS terms for gravity,
QCD, and QED in 3+1 dimensions, thereby integrating CS contributions within the
locally scale-invariant and geodesically complete paradigm. Additionally, we
establish a holographic correspondence between the new CS terms in 3+1
dimensions and novel 4+2 dimensional CS-type actions within 2T-physics. We
demonstrate that the Weyl transformation in 3+1 dimensions arises from 4+2
general coordinate transformations, which unify the hidden extra 1+1 large (not
curled up) dimensions with the evident 3+1 dimensions. By leveraging the
newfound local conformal symmetry, the augmented and geodesically complete
SM+GR+CS introduces innovative tools and perspectives for exploring classical
field theory aspects of black hole and cosmological singularities in 3+1
dimensions, while the 4+2 dimensional connection unveils deeper facets of
spacetime.

**Abstract**: Throughout quantum science and technology, measurement is used as a powerful
resource for nonlinear operations and quantum state engineering. In particular,
single-photon detection is commonly employed for quantum-information
applications and tests of fundamental physics. By contrast, and perhaps
counter-intuitively, measurement of the absence of photons also provides useful
information, and offers significant potential for a wide range of new
experimental directions. Here, we propose and experimentally demonstrate
cooling of a mechanical resonator below its laser-cooled mechanical occupation
via zero-photon detection on the anti-Stokes scattered optical field and verify
this cooling through heterodyne measurements. Our measurements are well
captured by a stochastic master equation and the techniques introduced here
open new avenues for cooling, quantum thermodynamics, quantum state
engineering, and quantum measurement and control.

**PDF Url**: [2401.06106v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2401.06106v2)

**Abstract**: Bayesian optimization (BO) protocol based on Active Learning (AL) principles
has garnered significant attention due to its ability to optimize black-box
objective functions efficiently. This capability is a prerequisite for guiding
autonomous and high-throughput materials design and discovery processes.
However, its application in materials science, particularly for novel alloy
designs with multiple targeted properties, remains limited. This limitation is
due to the computational complexity and the lack of reliable and robust
acquisition functions for multiobjective optimization. In recent years,
expected hypervolume-based geometrical acquisition functions have demonstrated
superior performance and speed compared to other multiobjective optimization
algorithms, such as Thompson Sampling Efficient Multiobjective Optimization
(TSEMO), Pareto Efficient Global Optimization (parEGO), etc. This work compares
several state-of-the-art multiobjective BO acquisition functions, i.e.,
parallel expected hypervolume improvement (qEHVI), noisy parallel expected
hypervolume improvement (qNEHVI), parallel Pareto efficient global optimization
(parEGO), and parallel noisy Pareto efficient global optimization (qNparEGO)
for the multiobjective optimization of physical properties in multi-component
alloys. We demonstrate the impressive performance of the qEHVI acquisition
function in finding the optimum Pareto front in 1-, 2-, and 3-objective
Aluminium alloy optimization problems within a limited evaluation budget and
reasonable computational cost. In addition, we discuss the role of different
surrogate model optimization methods from a computational cost and efficiency
perspective.


## Diffusion
### An Object is Worth 64x64 Pixels: Generating 3D Object via Image Diffusion
**Authors**: Xingguang Yan, Han-Hung Lee, Ziyu Wan, Angel X. Chang

**Published Date**: 2024-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2408.03178v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03178v1)

**Abstract**: We introduce a new approach for generating realistic 3D models with UV maps
through a representation termed "Object Images." This approach encapsulates
surface geometry, appearance, and patch structures within a 64x64 pixel image,
effectively converting complex 3D shapes into a more manageable 2D format. By
doing so, we address the challenges of both geometric and semantic irregularity
inherent in polygonal meshes. This method allows us to use image generation
models, such as Diffusion Transformers, directly for 3D shape generation.
Evaluated on the ABO dataset, our generated shapes with patch structures
achieve point cloud FID comparable to recent 3D generative models, while
naturally supporting PBR material generation.

**Published Date**: 2024-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2408.03156v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.03156v1)

**Abstract**: Image generative AI has garnered significant attention in recent years. In
particular, the diffusion model, a core component of recent generative AI,
produces high-quality images with rich diversity. In this study, we propose a
novel CT reconstruction method by combining the denoising diffusion
probabilistic model with iterative CT reconstruction. In sharp contrast to
previous studies, we optimize the fidelity loss of CT reconstruction with
respect to the latent variable of the diffusion model, instead of the image and
model parameters. To suppress anatomical structure changes produced by the
diffusion model, we shallow the diffusion and reverse processes, and fix a set
of added noises in the reverse process to make it deterministic during
inference. We demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method through
sparse view CT reconstruction of 1/10 view projection data. Despite the
simplicity of the implementation, the proposed method shows the capability of
reconstructing high-quality images while preserving the patient's anatomical
structure, and outperforms existing methods including iterative reconstruction,
iterative reconstruction with total variation, and the diffusion model alone in
terms of quantitative indices such as SSIM and PSNR. We also explore further
sparse view CT using 1/20 view projection data with the same trained diffusion
model. As the number of iterations increases, image quality improvement
comparable to that of 1/10 sparse view CT reconstruction is achieved. In
principle, the proposed method can be widely applied not only to CT but also to
other imaging modalities such as MRI, PET, and SPECT.


### FBSDiff: Plug-and-Play Frequency Band Substitution of Diffusion Features for Highly Controllable Text-Driven Image Translation
**Authors**: Xiang Gao, Jiaying Liu

**Published Date**: 2024-08-02

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2408.00998v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.00998v2)

**Abstract**: Large-scale text-to-image diffusion models have been a revolutionary
milestone in the evolution of generative AI and multimodal technology, allowing
wonderful image generation with natural-language text prompt. However, the
issue of lacking controllability of such models restricts their practical
applicability for real-life content creation. Thus, attention has been focused
on leveraging a reference image to control text-to-image synthesis, which is
also regarded as manipulating (or editing) a reference image as per a text
prompt, namely, text-driven image-to-image translation. This paper contributes
a novel, concise, and efficient approach that adapts pre-trained large-scale
text-to-image (T2I) diffusion model to the image-to-image (I2I) paradigm in a
plug-and-play manner, realizing high-quality and versatile text-driven I2I
translation without any model training, model fine-tuning, or online
optimization process. To guide T2I generation with a reference image, we
propose to decompose diverse guiding factors with different frequency bands of
diffusion features in the DCT spectral space, and accordingly devise a novel
frequency band substitution layer which realizes dynamic control of the
reference image to the T2I generation result in a plug-and-play manner. We
demonstrate that our method allows flexible control over both guiding factor
and guiding intensity of the reference image simply by tuning the type and
bandwidth of the substituted frequency band, respectively. Extensive
qualitative and quantitative experiments verify superiority of our approach
over related methods in I2I translation visual quality, versatility, and
controllability. The code is publicly available at:

### Diffusion Posterior Proximal Sampling for Image Restoration

**PDF Url**: [2402.16907v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.16907v2)

**Abstract**: Diffusion models have demonstrated remarkable efficacy in generating
high-quality samples. Existing diffusion-based image restoration algorithms
exploit pre-trained diffusion models to leverage data priors, yet they still
preserve elements inherited from the unconditional generation paradigm. These
strategies initiate the denoising process with pure white noise and incorporate
random noise at each generative step, leading to over-smoothed results. In this
paper, we present a refined paradigm for diffusion-based image restoration.
Specifically, we opt for a sample consistent with the measurement identity at
each generative step, exploiting the sampling selection as an avenue for output
stability and enhancement. The number of candidate samples used for selection
is adaptively determined based on the signal-to-noise ratio of the timestep.
Additionally, we start the restoration process with an initialization combined
with the measurement signal, providing supplementary information to better
align the generative process. Extensive experimental results and analyses
validate that our proposed method significantly enhances image restoration
performance while consuming negligible additional computational resources.


### Data-Driven Stochastic Closure Modeling via Conditional Diffusion Model and Neural Operator
**Authors**: Xinghao Dong, Chuanqi Chen, Jin-Long Wu

**Published Date**: 2024-08-06

**Updated Date**: 2024-08-06

**PDF Url**: [2408.02965v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2408.02965v1)

**Abstract**: Closure models are widely used in simulating complex multiscale dynamical
systems such as turbulence and the earth system, for which direct numerical
simulation that resolves all scales is often too expensive. For those systems
without a clear scale separation, deterministic and local closure models often
lack enough generalization capability, which limits their performance in many
real-world applications. In this work, we propose a data-driven modeling
framework for constructing stochastic and non-local closure models via
conditional diffusion model and neural operator. Specifically, the Fourier
neural operator is incorporated into a score-based diffusion model, which
serves as a data-driven stochastic closure model for complex dynamical systems
governed by partial differential equations (PDEs). We also demonstrate how
accelerated sampling methods can improve the efficiency of the data-driven
stochastic closure model. The results show that the proposed methodology
provides a systematic approach via generative machine learning techniques to
construct data-driven stochastic closure models for multiscale dynamical
systems with continuous spatiotemporal fields.
