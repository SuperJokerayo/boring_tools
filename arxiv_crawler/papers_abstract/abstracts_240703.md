**Abstract**: We present Magic Insert, a method for dragging-and-dropping subjects from a
user-provided image into a target image of a different style in a physically
plausible manner while matching the style of the target image. This work
formalizes the problem of style-aware drag-and-drop and presents a method for
tackling it by addressing two sub-problems: style-aware personalization and
realistic object insertion in stylized images. For style-aware personalization,
our method first fine-tunes a pretrained text-to-image diffusion model using
LoRA and learned text tokens on the subject image, and then infuses it with a
CLIP representation of the target style. For object insertion, we use
Bootstrapped Domain Adaption to adapt a domain-specific photorealistic object
insertion model to the domain of diverse artistic styles. Overall, the method
significantly outperforms traditional approaches such as inpainting. Finally,
we present a dataset, SubjectPlop, to facilitate evaluation and future progress
in this area. Project page: https://magicinsert.github.io/

**Abstract**: This Letter aims to advance unexplored properties of a new class of Closed
Timelike Curves recently discovered in scalar-tensor gravity, reported in
Universe 9, 467 (2023) and Eur.$\,$Phys.$\,$J.$\,$C 83, 626 (2023). Therein, it
was shown that when the Weak Energy Condition is violated, the topology of
spacetime in scalar-tensor gravity is altered, enabling the formation of
two-way traversable wormholes. Furthermore, each of these wormholes acts a
gateway between two $\textit{time-mirrored}$ worlds, where the two
asymptotically flat sheets in the Kruskal-Szekeres diagram are glued
antipodally along $\textit{three}$ directions -- time $t$ and the polar and
azimuth angles $(\theta,\,\varphi)$ of the 2-sphere -- to form a wormhole
throat. This contrasts with the standard embedding diagram which typically
glues the sheets only along the $\theta$ and $\varphi$ directions. Crucially,
due to the `gluing' along the $t$ direction, the wormhole becomes a portal
connecting the two spacetime sheets with $\textit{opposite}$ physical time
flows, enabling the emergence of closed timelike loops which straddle the
throat. We shall point out that this portal $\textit{mathematically}$ permits
the possibility of backward propagation of information $\textit{against}$ time.
This feature is ubiquitous for wormholes in scalar-tensor theories. In
addition, we formulate the Feynman sum for transition amplitudes of microscopic
particles in the proximity of a wormhole throat in which we account for
timelike paths that experience time reversal.

**Authors**: Oliver George Bond, Peter Denis Howell

**Published Date**: 2024-07-02

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2407.02470v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02470v1)

**Abstract**: We derive a mathematical model for steady, unidirectional, thermoelectric
magnetohydrodynamic (TEMHD) flow of liquid lithium along a solid metal trench,
subject to an imposed heat flux. We use a finite-element method implemented in
COMSOL Multiphysics to solve the problem numerically, demonstrating how the
fluid velocity, induced magnetic field and temperature change depending on the
key physical and geometrical parameters. The observed flow structures are
elucidated by using the method of matched asymptotic expansions to obtain
approximate solutions in the limit where the Hartmann number is large and the
trench walls are thin.

**Abstract**: Magnetic systems can exhibit thermally activated transitions whose timescales
are often described by an Arrhenius law. However, robust predictions of such
timescales are only available for certain cases. Inspired by the harmonic
theory of Langer, we derive a general activation rate for multi-dimensional
spin systems. Assuming local thermal equilibrium in the initial minimum and
deriving an expression for the flow of probability density along the real
unstable dynamical mode at the saddle point, we obtain the expression for the
activation rate that is a function of the Gilbert damping parameter, $\alpha$.
We find that this expression remains valid for the physically relevant regime
of $\alpha\ll1$. When the activation is characterized by a coherent
reorientation of all spins, we gain insight into the prefactor of the Arrhenius
law by writing it in terms of spin wave frequencies and, for the case of a
finite antiferromagnetic spin chain, obtain an expression that depends
exponentially on the square of the system size indicating a break-down of the
Meyer-Neldel rule.

**Abstract**: This paper presents the Learning the Universe Implicit Likelihood Inference
(LtU-ILI) pipeline, a codebase for rapid, user-friendly, and cutting-edge
machine learning (ML) inference in astrophysics and cosmology. The pipeline
includes software for implementing various neural architectures, training
schemata, priors, and density estimators in a manner easily adaptable to any
research workflow. It includes comprehensive validation metrics to assess
posterior estimate coverage, enhancing the reliability of inferred results.
Additionally, the pipeline is easily parallelizable and is designed for
efficient exploration of modeling hyperparameters. To demonstrate its
capabilities, we present real applications across a range of astrophysics and
cosmology problems, such as: estimating galaxy cluster masses from X-ray
photometry; inferring cosmology from matter power spectra and halo point
clouds; characterizing progenitors in gravitational wave signals; capturing
physical dust parameters from galaxy colors and luminosities; and establishing
properties of semi-analytic models of galaxy formation. We also include
exhaustive benchmarking and comparisons of all implemented methods as well as
discussions about the challenges and pitfalls of ML inference in astronomical
sciences. All code and examples are made publicly available at

**Abstract**: Collective phenomena in physics emerge from interactions among numerous
components in a complex system, leading to behaviors distinct from those of
individual parts. This domain includes classical phenomena like synchronization
and extends to quantum phenomena such as Bose-Einstein condensation and
super-radiance. Studying these phenomena in controlled artificial systems
allows for simulating complex natural systems. Solid-state mechanical
oscillators, controllable via optomechanical coupling, have been proposed for
exploring collective phenomena, but experimental realizations face the
challenge of requiring nearly degenerate mechanical oscillators. In this work,
we present the collective behavior of six mechanical oscillators coupled to a
common cavity in a superconducting circuit optomechanical platform. We
experimentally demonstrate that increasing the optomechanical coupling rates
induces a transition from individual mechanical oscillators to a collective
mode, characterized by equal amplitude and relative phase of the oscillators.
By utilizing the finite non-degeneracy of mechanical frequencies and rapidly
quenching the optomechanical couplings, we directly measure the amplitude and
relative phase of the oscillators in the collective mode. We find that the
coupling rate of such mode to the cavity increases with the number of coupled
oscillators, similar to a Tavis-Cummings system. Further increasing the
coupling rates pushes this collective mode into the strong coupling regime with
the cavity. We demonstrate sideband ground-state cooling of the collective
mode, achieving a 0.4 quanta occupation, and observe quantum sideband asymmetry
for this mode. Observing collective optomechanical phenomena in the quantum
regime opens avenues for studying synchronization, investigating topological
phases of sound, and achieving multipartite phonon-phonon and photon-phonon
entanglement.


### Meta 3D AssetGen: Text-to-Mesh Generation with High-Quality Geometry, Texture, and PBR Materials
**Authors**: Yawar Siddiqui, Tom Monnier, Filippos Kokkinos, Mahendra Kariya, Yanir Kleiman, Emilien Garreau, Oran Gafni, Natalia Neverova, Andrea Vedaldi, Roman Shapovalov, David Novotny

**Published Date**: 2024-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2407.02445v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02445v1)

**Abstract**: We present Meta 3D AssetGen (AssetGen), a significant advancement in
text-to-3D generation which produces faithful, high-quality meshes with texture
and material control. Compared to works that bake shading in the 3D object's
appearance, AssetGen outputs physically-based rendering (PBR) materials,
supporting realistic relighting. AssetGen generates first several views of the
object with factored shaded and albedo appearance channels, and then
reconstructs colours, metalness and roughness in 3D, using a deferred shading
loss for efficient supervision. It also uses a sign-distance function to
represent 3D shape more reliably and introduces a corresponding loss for direct
shape supervision. This is implemented using fused kernels for high memory
efficiency. After mesh extraction, a texture refinement transformer operating
in UV space significantly improves sharpness and details. AssetGen achieves 17%
improvement in Chamfer Distance and 40% in LPIPS over the best concurrent work
for few-view reconstruction, and a human preference of 72% over the best
industry competitors of comparable speed, including those that support PBR.

### Deconstructing flavor anomalously
**Authors**: Javier Fuentes-Martín, Javier M. Lizana

**Published Date**: 2024-02-14

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2402.09507v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.09507v2)

**Abstract**: Flavor deconstruction refers to ultraviolet completions of the Standard Model
where the gauge group is split into multiple factors under which fermions
transform non-universally. We propose a mechanism for charging same-family
fermions into different factors of a deconstructed gauge theory in a way that
gauge anomalies are avoided. The mechanism relies in the inclusion of a
strongly-coupled sector, responsible of both anomaly cancellation and the
breaking of the non-universal gauge symmetry. As an application, we propose
different flavor deconstructions of the Standard Model that, instead of
complete families, uniquely identify specific third-family fermions. All these
deconstructions allow for a new physics scale that can be as low as few TeV and
provide an excellent starting point for the explanation of the Standard Model
flavor hierarchies.


### Sentient observers and the ontology of spacetime
**Authors**: Ovidiu Cristinel Stoica

**Published Date**: 2024-07-02

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2407.02421v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02421v1)

**Abstract**: I show that, by the same criteria that led to Galilean and Special Relativity
and gauge symmetries, there is no way to identify a unique set of observables
that give the structure of space or spacetime. In some sense, space is lost in
the state space itself. Moreover, the relationship between the observables and
the physical properties they represent becomes relative. But we can verify that
they are not relative, and the spacetime structure is unique. I show that this
implies that not all structures isomorphic with observers can be observers,
contradicting Structural Realism and Physicalism. This indicates a strong
connection between spacetime and the sentience of the observers, as anticipated
by some early contributors to Special and General Relativity.


### Approximate symmetries, insulators, and superconductivity in continuum-model description of twisted WSe$_2$
**Authors**: Maine Christos, Pietro M. Bonetti, Mathias S. Scheurer

**Published Date**: 2024-07-02

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2407.02393v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02393v1)

**Abstract**: Motivated by the recent discovery of superconductivity in twisted bilayer
WSe$_2$, we analyze the correlated physics in this system in the framework of a
continuum model for the moir\'e superlattice. Using the symmetries in a
fine-tuned limit of the system, we identify the strong-coupling ground states
and their fate when the perturbations caused by finite bandwidth, displacement
field, and the phase of the intralayer potential are taken into account. We
classify the superconducting instabilities and, employing a spin-fermion-like
model, study the superconducting instabilities in proximity to these insulating
particle-hole orders. This reveals that only a neighboring intervalley coherent
phase (with zero or finite wave vector) is naturally consistent with the
observed superconducting state. Depending on details, the superconductor will
be nodal or a chiral gapped state while further including electron-phonon
coupling leads to a fully gapped, time-reversal symmetric pairing state.


## Diffusion
### Naturalistic Music Decoding from EEG Data via Latent Diffusion Models
**Authors**: Emilian Postolache, Natalia Polouliakh, Hiroaki Kitano, Akima Connelly, Emanuele Rodolà, Luca Cosmo, Taketo Akama

**PDF Url**: [2405.09062v3](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2405.09062v3)

**Abstract**: In this article, we explore the potential of using latent diffusion models, a
family of powerful generative models, for the task of reconstructing
naturalistic music from electroencephalogram (EEG) recordings. Unlike simpler
music with limited timbres, such as MIDI-generated tunes or monophonic pieces,
the focus here is on intricate music featuring a diverse array of instruments,
voices, and effects, rich in harmonics and timbre. This study represents an
initial foray into achieving general music reconstruction of high-quality using
non-invasive EEG data, employing an end-to-end training approach directly on
raw data without the need for manual pre-processing and channel selection. We
train our models on the public NMED-T dataset and perform quantitative
evaluation proposing neural embedding-based metrics. We additionally perform
song classification based on the generated tracks. Our work contributes to the
ongoing research in neural decoding and brain-computer interfaces, offering
insights into the feasibility of using EEG data for complex auditory
information reconstruction.


### Greedy-DiM: Greedy Algorithms for Unreasonably Effective Face Morphs
**Authors**: Zander W. Blasingame, Chen Liu

**Published Date**: 2024-04-09

**Updated Date**: 2024-07-02

**PDF Url**: [2404.06025v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2404.06025v2)

**Abstract**: Morphing attacks are an emerging threat to state-of-the-art Face Recognition
(FR) systems, which aim to create a single image that contains the biometric
information of multiple identities. Diffusion Morphs (DiM) are a recently
proposed morphing attack that has achieved state-of-the-art performance for
representation-based morphing attacks. However, none of the existing research
on DiMs have leveraged the iterative nature of DiMs and left the DiM model as a
black box, treating it no differently than one would a Generative Adversarial
Network (GAN) or Varational AutoEncoder (VAE). We propose a greedy strategy on
the iterative sampling process of DiM models which searches for an optimal step
guided by an identity-based heuristic function. We compare our proposed
algorithm against ten other state-of-the-art morphing algorithms using the
open-source SYN-MAD 2022 competition dataset. We find that our proposed
algorithm is unreasonably effective, fooling all of the tested FR systems with
an MMPMR of 100%, outperforming all other morphing algorithms compared.


### Diffusion Forcing: Next-token Prediction Meets Full-Sequence Diffusion

**PDF Url**: [2407.01392v2](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.01392v2)

**Abstract**: This paper presents Diffusion Forcing, a new training paradigm where a
diffusion model is trained to denoise a set of tokens with independent
per-token noise levels. We apply Diffusion Forcing to sequence generative
modeling by training a causal next-token prediction model to generate one or
several future tokens without fully diffusing past ones. Our approach is shown
to combine the strengths of next-token prediction models, such as
variable-length generation, with the strengths of full-sequence diffusion
models, such as the ability to guide sampling to desirable trajectories. Our
method offers a range of additional capabilities, such as (1) rolling-out
sequences of continuous tokens, such as video, with lengths past the training
horizon, where baselines diverge and (2) new sampling and guiding schemes that
uniquely profit from Diffusion Forcing's variable-horizon and causal
architecture, and which lead to marked performance gains in decision-making and
planning tasks. In addition to its empirical success, our method is proven to
optimize a variational lower bound on the likelihoods of all subsequences of
tokens drawn from the true joint distribution. Project website:

### Counterfactual Data Augmentation with Denoising Diffusion for Graph Anomaly Detection

**PDF Url**: [2407.02143v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02143v1)

**Abstract**: A critical aspect of Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is to enhance the node
representations by aggregating node neighborhood information. However, when
detecting anomalies, the representations of abnormal nodes are prone to be
averaged by normal neighbors, making the learned anomaly representations less
distinguishable. To tackle this issue, we propose CAGAD -- an unsupervised
Counterfactual data Augmentation method for Graph Anomaly Detection -- which
introduces a graph pointer neural network as the heterophilic node detector to
identify potential anomalies whose neighborhoods are normal-node-dominant. For
each identified potential anomaly, we design a graph-specific diffusion model
to translate a part of its neighbors, which are probably normal, into anomalous
ones. At last, we involve these translated neighbors in GNN neighborhood
aggregation to produce counterfactual representations of anomalies. Through
aggregating the translated anomalous neighbors, counterfactual representations
become more distinguishable and further advocate detection performance. The
experimental results on four datasets demonstrate that CAGAD significantly
outperforms strong baselines, with an average improvement of 2.35% on F1, 2.53%
on AUC-ROC, and 2.79% on AUC-PR.


### Latent Diffusion Model for Generating Ensembles of Climate Simulations

**PDF Url**: [2407.02070v1](http://arxiv.org/pdf/2407.02070v1)

**Abstract**: Obtaining accurate estimates of uncertainty in climate scenarios often
requires generating large ensembles of high-resolution climate simulations, a
computationally expensive and memory intensive process. To address this
challenge, we train a novel generative deep learning approach on extensive sets
of climate simulations. The model consists of two components: a variational
autoencoder for dimensionality reduction and a denoising diffusion
probabilistic model that generates multiple ensemble members. We validate our
model on the Max Planck Institute Grand Ensemble and show that it achieves good
agreement with the original ensemble in terms of variability. By leveraging the
latent space representation, our model can rapidly generate large ensembles
on-the-fly with minimal memory requirements, which can significantly improve
the efficiency of uncertainty quantification in climate simulations.
